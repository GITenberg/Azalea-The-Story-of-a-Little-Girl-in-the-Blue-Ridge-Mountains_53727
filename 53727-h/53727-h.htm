<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>CHAPTER
I <br />
<span class="smcap">THE McBIRNEYS</span></h2>
<p>The guinea hens wanted everybody to get up.&nbsp; They said so
right under the bedroom window; and the turkey gobbler had the
same wish and made it known in his most important manner.&nbsp;
Hours before, Mr. Rhode Island Red, the rooster, had expressed
his opinion on the subject, and from the first pale hint of dawn
till the sun swung up in the clear May sky, a great company of
tanagers, robins, martins, meadow larks and their friends had
suggested, each in his own way, that it was time to be awake.</p>
<p>But really, it didn&rsquo;t need all of this clamor to get the
McBirneys out of bed.&nbsp; Since sunup, Thomas McBirney had been
planting cotton on the red clay terraces of his mountain farm;
and <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Mary
McBirney, his wife, had been busied laying her hearth-fire,
getting the breakfast and feeding the crowing, cackling, gobbling
creatures in the yard.&nbsp; And three times she had thrust her
head in at the door of the lean-to to say that if she were a boy
she&rsquo;d get up and see what a pretty day it was.</p>
<p>James Stuart McBirney, otherwise Jim, thought his mother was
right about almost everything, but he did differ with her about
getting up when a fellow felt like a log and his eyes were as
tight as ticks.&nbsp; He had heard her say there was a time for
everything, and it seemed to him that the time to sleep was when
a fellow was sleepy.&nbsp; Why should sensible people send him to
bed when he wasn&rsquo;t sleepy and make him get up when he
was?</p>
<p>Besides, something kept nagging away in the back of his
mind.&nbsp; It was something that he ought to remember, and
couldn&rsquo;t quite, on account of being so sleepy.&nbsp; Or
perhaps he didn&rsquo;t want to remember it.&nbsp; At any rate,
it wouldn&rsquo;t let him rest in comfort, but pecked away like a
woodpecker at a tree.&nbsp; So, in spite of himself, it all came
back to him.&nbsp; Ma was out of &ldquo;fat pine&rdquo; for
kindling, and he must go hunting it.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Well,
if he must&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t seem as you ought to be so long getting
into such a few clothes, Jimmy,&rdquo; a soft voice called.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be falling into lazy habits if you
don&rsquo;t set a watch on yourself, and you&rsquo;ll never get
shet of them, long as you live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessum,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see your pa a-coming &rsquo;cross the fields now,
and I reckon if you don&rsquo;t do some hustling he&rsquo;ll
catch you dawdling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Jimmy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hearing that Aunt Nan Leiter&rsquo;s
got a making of that blue dye like I&rsquo;ve been wanting.&nbsp;
I reckon after you&rsquo;ve got the wood you&rsquo;d better walk
over yon and get the bucket of it she promised to give
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Jimmy, here&rsquo;s your pa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you washed yet, son?&nbsp; Shame on
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a wild splashing of water on the back porch where
the wash basin stood, a gasping and panting, and then, with one
last &ldquo;Yessum,&rdquo; James Stuart McBirney stood in the <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>door.&nbsp;
His turned-up nose, his freckles and his blue eyes all shone as
if he had polished them, and his curling, clay-colored hair had
drawn itself up in tight ringlets about his head.</p>
<p>He had been hoping that no one would pay any attention to him,
and he had his wish.&nbsp; Ma was setting breakfast on the table,
steaming hot from the hearth.&nbsp; Pa was standing outside the
door shading his eyes with one hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What all are you peering at that a-way, Pa
McBirney?&rdquo; asked his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it some one
coming over the gap?&nbsp; I heard tell that Sam Bixby and his
brothers was about to bring over a string of horses from their
place for trading day at Lee.&nbsp; As like as not it&rsquo;s
them you&rsquo;re seeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No it ain&rsquo;t, Mary&mdash;and it ain&rsquo;t nobody
we ever set eyes on before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Thomas, how can you tell that, with them just
coming over the top of the gap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Pa McBirney, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
dumfoundered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Jim and his mother went to the door.&nbsp; They
thought it was about time to see what was ailing pa.&nbsp; The
three had a way of sharing everything; and it was no wonder that
they did so, <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>for they had only themselves for company.&nbsp; Their
cabin, with its two large rooms, its open chamber between, and
the lean-to, where Jim slept, sat on a pleasant bench of Mount
Tennyson, two thousand feet above the level of the sea.&nbsp;
Through their yard ran the road that carried people from over
Burlingame way, on the other side of the mountain, down to Lee,
the town that lay below them in the purple valley.&nbsp;
Sometimes, when the wind was right, they could hear the mill
whistles blow at Lee, or the church bells ring; and sometimes
they could see the houses there as plain as anything.&nbsp; But
usually the little town looked to them as if it were wrapped
around in purple veils; and when the rain came, it was swallowed
up in white blankness.</p>
<p>The McBirneys thought they lived in a very pleasant and
exciting place.&nbsp; Sometimes as many as five or six teams
passed their door in one day, and it was seldom indeed that
anyone drove by without stopping to pass the time of day.&nbsp;
If by chance the McBirneys were sitting down to a meal, the
travelers were asked to share it with them, and to water their
horses and take a little rest before going on down the
mountain.&nbsp; Ma said it was a fine thing for them, being taken
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>unawares
like that.&nbsp; It made them keep the house tidy and themselves
ready to see folks.&nbsp; But there were weeks of rain or snow
there on the mountain side when almost nobody passed, and when
the McBirneys couldn&rsquo;t get to town; and the only sounds to
be heard were their own voices and the baying of the four hounds,
or the crying of the trees and the crackling of the fire on the
hearth.</p>
<p>Not long ago, there had been four of them instead of
three.&nbsp; There had been Molly, Jim&rsquo;s little sister, a
little girl with hair the color of corn silk, and eyes as dark as
&ldquo;spider lilies.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now she was lying under
that tiny heap of earth beneath the Pride of India tree, and
Jim&rsquo;s mother was different&mdash;quite different&mdash;from
what she had been before.&nbsp; Her face was sweeter, perhaps,
but it looked so that Jim couldn&rsquo;t keep from crying, to
himself, of course.&nbsp; And in spite of all they could do, all
three of them kept counting Molly in; and now as he ran to the
door to see what was going on up there at the gap, he
couldn&rsquo;t help thinking how much more fun it would have been
if he and Molly had been pushing and scrambling and pretending to
see which could get out first, in <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the old way.&nbsp; In those old days
his mother would have been calling out in the laughing voice she
used to have:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, children, something&rsquo;s going
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now father, mother and boy were silent as they stood
together looking up where the red road made its way through the
forest over the gap.</p>
<p>Pa was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As near as I can make out,&rdquo; he said slowly,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s three wagons loaded to the limit, and a lot of
people on foot walking alongside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer doings, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; murmured ma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I allow I&rsquo;d better run up the road a
piece,&rdquo; Jim said, slipping in his words softly, as if he
hoped they might go unnoticed, &ldquo;and see what&rsquo;s
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I allow,&rdquo; said his father in his most
downright voice, &ldquo;that we-all will just sit down and eat
that there good breakfast ma has cooked, and if we keep eating
steady we&rsquo;ll be through with the whole business before them
folks, whoever they be, gets anywhere nigh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; added ma, &ldquo;I do wish you&rsquo;d
sit <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>down
and eat things while they&rsquo;re hot and fit for
eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they sat down and went at their breakfast as if it were a
piece of hard work that must be got out of the way, and then,
having finished and slipped what was left to Molly&rsquo;s cat
and the four hounds, they got out of doors as quickly as they
could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The procession is hid around the bend of the
road,&rdquo; said ma.</p>
<p>But even as she spoke the words, the &ldquo;procession&rdquo;
appeared, though it was almost above the McBirney&rsquo;s
heads.&nbsp; Both men and animals were moving along very slowly,
as if&mdash;as pa put it&mdash;they were &ldquo;dead
beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks,&rdquo; said ma softly, &ldquo;like a
funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it don&rsquo;t nuther, ma,&rdquo; pa answered
sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t look nothing like a
funeral.&nbsp; It looks like a family moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mighty large family then,
Thomas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s folks going down to work in the cotton
mill at Lee,&rdquo; Jim suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard Rath
Rutherford saying there was agents going all through the
mountains, asking folks to go down and work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, folks with children,&rdquo; snapped Pa <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>McBirney.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind they want,
and that&rsquo;s the kind that&rsquo;ll go&mdash;folks that can
get their boys and girls in the mill and make &rsquo;em work for
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d see <i>myself</i> lying down and
letting my children put food in my mouth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as near as I can make out,&rdquo; said Mary
McBirney, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s only two children in that
company.&nbsp; All the rest is grown folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three wagons with their sagging cloth tops, swung around
the next curve and turned toward the McBirney cabin.&nbsp; The
horses walked with drooping heads; the people dragged their
feet.&nbsp; Pa went forward to meet them, and close behind him,
trying hard to see and not to be seen, went Jim.&nbsp; Ma
McBirney went back and sat on a chair in the doorway, something
as a queen might go back and sit on her throne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; said pa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; responded the man who led the first pair
of horses.</p>
<p>Pa asked no questions&mdash;that would not have been polite
according to his idea.&nbsp; He seemed not to look at the tired
horses or the still more weary men and women, or at the wagons
with their queer load.&nbsp; All he said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good spring of water over yon, if <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>so be
you&rsquo;re wanting water; and this here bench is a good one to
rest on before going on down the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By &ldquo;bench&rdquo; he meant, of course, the level bit of
land on the mountain side.</p>
<p>Jim knew that his father was simply quivering inside, just as
he was himself, to know what those people were doing and what
they were carrying in their wagons.</p>
<p>The man looked at pa and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re about tuckered out,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come far?&rdquo; asked pa.&nbsp; It hurt his pride to
ask the question, but he had to do it.&nbsp; The man looked at pa
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re always on the road,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a show here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A show!&nbsp; Jim felt something running up his
spine&mdash;something that felt as cold and swift as a
lizard.&nbsp; It was really a thrill of excitement, but Jim was
afraid it was some sort of sickness.&nbsp; He was not used to the
feeling.</p>
<p>The queer procession came to a stop in the McBirney
clearing.&nbsp; There were three covered wagons, six thin horses,
five men, two women, a boy and a girl.&nbsp; All were
walking.&nbsp; The man to whom pa had spoken was pale, fat and
tired <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>looking, and while pa was looking him over in his quiet
way the man took off his hat and wiped the moisture from his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of luck,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dying woman in that last wagon&mdash;the
smartest performer of the bunch.&nbsp; Sing or dance or
anything.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s her girl there.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
pointed to a slender girl of about Jim&rsquo;s own age, who stood
staring off into the valley, though Jim, who had seen that same
sort of a look in his mother&rsquo;s face, knew she wasn&rsquo;t
really seeing it.&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t seeing anything, he
decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho!&rdquo; murmured Pa McBirney.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dying?&nbsp; Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man thwacked a huge horsefly on his horse&rsquo;s
flank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>One of the women asked pa if they might cook their breakfast
in the open &ldquo;rock&rdquo; fireplace that stood there in the
yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said pa quickly.&nbsp; And
then he called: &ldquo;Here, ma, these folks want to cook their
breakfast here a-way.&nbsp; And they say there&rsquo;s a mighty
sick woman in that tent-wagon yon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary McBirney, whose shyness had kept her <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>sitting as
still as if she were under some spell, got up at once when she
heard this, and came forward.&nbsp; She nodded to the men and
women without really looking at them, because that was her way
with strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the sick woman, please?&rdquo; she asked
in her soft voice.&nbsp; The girl who had stood looking at the
valley turned at this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you, please ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she
said, and her voice sounded so tired that it made a lump come in
Jim&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>Mary McBirney reached down and took the girl&rsquo;s thin
brown hand in her own, and the two went on to the wagon, the
others watching them.&nbsp; They saw her lean forward and look in
the wagon, and then draw back with a startled face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s over!&rdquo; she called.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pa!&nbsp; Pa!&nbsp; The poor soul&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that the other women ran toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she was breathing a mile or two back,&rdquo; the
one they called Betty said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I looked in at her and
gave her a drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t stay in the wagon because it shut out
the air,&rdquo; explained the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Zalie here,
wanted to stay with her mamma, but we coaxed <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>her not to,
for the poor thing needed all the air she could get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the girl was in the wagon now, letting her tears rain on
the face of the only one in all the world she ever had called her
own.</p>
<p>Betty Bowen began to call to her to come out, but Ma McBirney
said: &ldquo;Just let her cry!&nbsp; Poor little
thing&mdash;she&rsquo;s just got to cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty Bowen, and her friend Susan Hetter, began to sniffle a
little too, but Mary McBirney looking at them made up her mind
that they were not caring very much.&nbsp; They looked too
dragged out to care about anything.&nbsp; The dust of the road
seemed to have got into their very skin; they looked as if they
never had slept in a proper bed or dressed in a proper room; and
though Mrs. McBirney did not like them, and could hardly keep
from drawing away from them, she felt very sorry for them
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the girl&rsquo;s pa?&rdquo; she asked
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Betty Bowen said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mrs. Knox&mdash;that&rsquo;s the dead woman,
ma&rsquo;am&mdash;never said anything about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t she got no kin?&rdquo; asked ma gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None that we know of, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim stood looking on, his lips pressed hard <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>together.&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s mother was dead.&nbsp;
<i>Her mother was dead</i>!&nbsp; Why, that must be like having
the world come to an end, pretty near.&nbsp; If your mother was
dead, it didn&rsquo;t matter if you did belong to a show.&nbsp;
But that boy over there, his mother wasn&rsquo;t dead, and yet he
acted as &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; as a snail.&nbsp; Jim felt that if
he, himself, belonged to a show he&rsquo;d be yelling and jumping
and having a whopping time.&nbsp; Every spare minute he&rsquo;d
be practicing up in his part.&nbsp; But these folks acted as if
they hardly had life enough to cross the yard; and as for the
horses, their heads hung down and their bones stuck out as if
they were ready for the buzzards to pick.&nbsp; Jim hated to have
that girl crying like that.&nbsp; There was no fun in having a
show in your yard when a girl was making such a noise.&nbsp; He
tried to forget about it, and walked around looking in the
wagons&mdash;not the wagon where the girl was, but the
others&mdash;hoping to find some wild animals in cages.&nbsp; But
the only wild animals he saw were made out of wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s them for?&rdquo; he asked one of the men,
pointing to a wooden zebra and a somewhat faded tiger.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;For the merry-go-round,&rdquo; said the
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ever see one?&rdquo;&nbsp; Jim shook his head,
and the man tried to tell him what a merry-go-round was
like.&nbsp; Jim was disgusted to think how long he had lived
without seeing anything like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; he said to the man, &ldquo;that
this here bench would be a good place to set up your
show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fine!&rdquo; answered the man with a disagreeable
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then all the jack rabbits and spit cats in
the whole neighborhood could come, couldn&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d set it up, please sir,&rdquo; said Jim,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d run all over the mountain in no time, telling
the folks about it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s lots of folks on this
mountain&mdash;more&rsquo;n you&rsquo;d think.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d
pay you money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the head man, Sisson, had come up and begun talking about
the dead woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just figuring,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whether
to take her down to a burying ground in the next town, or to make
a grave up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Jim&rsquo;s father came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife says for you-all to leave that poor woman right
up here,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She can be buried out there
by that Pride of India tree <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>beside our little girl, and ma will
keep everything looking fine&mdash;plant roses, you know, and all
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men didn&rsquo;t seem to care much about roses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Sisson shortly;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could it be &lsquo;all right&rsquo;?&rdquo; Jim
wondered.&nbsp; Now that he had stopped talking about the show he
could hear that girl again, and it made him feel very, very
queer.&nbsp; The lump came back in his throat and things sort of
shook before his eyes.&nbsp; He felt as if something in him was
going to burst.&nbsp; And just then some one touched him on the
shoulder.&nbsp; He looked up and saw his mother standing
there.&nbsp; Her face seemed unusually thin and white and her
eyes very large, and there was something so kind&mdash;so
terribly, heart-breakingly kind&mdash;in them, that the something
in him did burst, and he found himself crying in his
mother&rsquo;s dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon if you feel as sorry as that for the poor
girl, you&rsquo;ll like to do something to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim nodded, not being able to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you get a cup of fresh milk and carry it to my
bedroom.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to get the poor child in there and
coax her to lie down.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Jim ran
to the spring house&mdash;tormented all the while with those sobs
in his throat&mdash;and filled the tall horn cup with milk.&nbsp;
When he carried it into his mother&rsquo;s room he found the girl
lying on the bed, with Ma McBirney bathing her face and talking
to her softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m unplaiting your hair, dear,&rdquo; she was
saying in a voice so soft that it made Jim think of the pigeons
out at the barn, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to smooth it.&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t mind, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said the girl brokenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s the milk, all nice and cold.&nbsp; If
it would please you to drink a little of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She half-lifted the little figure in her arms and held her so
while the girl let the cool milk run down her hot throat.&nbsp;
Jim noticed that when she lay down again, she took the edge of
ma&rsquo;s apron between her fingers and held on to it.&nbsp; Jim
understood why.&nbsp; He felt just like doing that himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My little girl that died,&rdquo; said ma, still in that
soft, cooing voice, &ldquo;had yellow hair.&nbsp; Yours is brown,
but it&rsquo;s just as pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl twisted ma&rsquo;s apron in and out around her
fingers; she could think of nothing to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My little Molly&rsquo;s eyes was blue, but yours is
just the color of Job&rsquo;s tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>&ldquo;Job&rsquo;s tears?&rdquo; asked the girl.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What are they, please ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what Job&rsquo;s tears be,
honey?&nbsp; Why they&rsquo;re the prettiest little
things&mdash;sort of beans, they be&mdash;and folks dries and
strings &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Jimmy, you fetch that string from the
bureau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim brought the string of softly polished gray beadlike
things, and Ma McBirney slipped them softly over the girl&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They just match your eyes, honey.&nbsp; You must wear
them to remember me by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll remember
you anyway.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be taking care of mamma for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now here, honey, don&rsquo;t you start crying
again!&nbsp; You can do all the crying you want by and by.&nbsp;
But now I want you to listen to me.&nbsp; What call have you got
to go on with them show people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else can I do, ma&rsquo;am?&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
all the people I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you do in the show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much now since my pony died.&nbsp; I used to ride
him, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Now I sell things&mdash;peanuts or
pictures or songs or anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wave of scarlet went over her face, and <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Jim knew she
hated being with the show and he wondered why.&nbsp; He would
have liked to do that kind of thing very well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me&mdash;I won&rsquo;t tell no one&mdash;be they
good to you?&rdquo; asked ma.</p>
<p>The girl turned her tear-darkened eyes on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;
she broke out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so tired!&nbsp; What
shall I do?&nbsp; What shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma McBirney stooped down and put both arms tight about the
girl&rsquo;s shaking form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;d better stay right here with
me,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m needing a little girl
terrible; and you&rsquo;ve lost your ma.&nbsp; You stay right
here with me.&nbsp; What do you say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sat up in bed and looked straight into Ma
McBirney&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d never let me!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now maybe they would, dear.&nbsp; Would you like
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; sighed the girl; &ldquo;Oh,
ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that name I heard them calling you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zalie, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; My name is Azalea.&rdquo;</p>

28</span>CHAPTER II<br />
NEW FRIENDS</h2>
<p>How does news spread on the mountain side?&nbsp; Who carried
the word to the little lonely cabins on the wide sides of old
Tennyson mountain that there were &ldquo;things going on&rdquo;
at the McBirney&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Did the buzzards wing the
message&mdash;or the bald-headed eagle that kept eyrie in the
blasted Norway pine above the ginseng lot?&nbsp; Or the martins
that made their home in the dried gourds that had been swung for
them on the high crosstrees before the McBirney&rsquo;s door?</p>
<p>However that may be, by noon the people began to arrive.&nbsp;
Some of them rode their mules or horses; some drove in their
carts or wagons; but the greater number came on foot, slipping
along the steep paths on the pine needles, or leaping among the
rocks, sure of foot, long of limb, and caring nothing for
distance.</p>
<p>They were quiet folk with soft voices and with their hearts in
the right place.&nbsp; So, though they wanted as much as if they
had been <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>children, to see the merry-go-round and all the rest of
the show, they would not so much as hint at it because of the
dead woman who lay all clean and decent on the ironing board laid
across two sawhorses, there in the open room between the bedroom
and the kitchen, in Mary McBirney&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Over her a
fresh sheet fell.&nbsp; On her bosom lay branches of wild azalea,
for her name, too, had been Azalea.</p>
<p>The mistress of the house went about with a strange look on
her face.&nbsp; She listened to all that was said to her, but she
seemed not really to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ma hadn&rsquo;t ought to be seeing all these folks
and going through this experience,&rdquo; Thomas McBirney said to
his boy Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting on her
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that there girl,&rdquo; Jim whispered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I heard her asking her if she didn&rsquo;t want to live
here with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho!&rdquo; said pa.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how the
land lays!&nbsp; And what did the little girl say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might go for some fresh water to the spring,&rdquo;
said Jim, &ldquo;and then we can talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So these two good friends set off together, and <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Jim told his
father all that he had heard his mother and Azalea say to each
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal of whiskey being passed
around on the quiet among them show folks,&rdquo; said pa.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t only the men that&rsquo;s taking it
neither.&nbsp; I hold with your ma that we&rsquo;ve got a call to
see to that girl.&nbsp; What if our Molly had been left like that
and she&rsquo;d fallen to the care of them that was evil in their
ways, and been let go to destruction by Christians that might
have saved her and wouldn&rsquo;t on account of blind
self-seeking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On their way back from the spring they saw old Elder Mills
coming along on his tall mule.&nbsp; Some one had summoned him to
preach the funeral sermon.&nbsp; Jim knew just how he would do,
shouting out in his wild singsong till the mountains echoed, and
filling the people with fear.&nbsp; He looked like a giant as he
rode toward them, his thick, curling iron-gray hair standing out
all over his head and his dark eyes burning like fires in their
deep sockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look a-here, Elder,&rdquo; Pa McBirney said;
&ldquo;before we get up where the folks is, I&rsquo;ve a request
to make of you.&nbsp; You size up them there <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>show
people.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve had experience and you know the good
from the bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judge not that ye be not judged!&rdquo; roared the
elder.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the Lord&rsquo;s business to divide the
sheep from the goats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, maybe, Elder,&rdquo; said pa soothingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re something of a hand at it yourself.&nbsp;
And I&rsquo;m asking you to see my wife in private.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s got something on her mind, Elder, and she needs your
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, brother McBirney,&rdquo; the elder
agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anything I can do for sister McBirney, it
gives me pleasure to do, sir, for a better woman I never did
know, and I&rsquo;ve known a power of good ones in my
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour after they had got back to the clearing, Jimmy,
who was standing around waiting for a chance to get acquainted
with the boy who had come with the show people, heard his father
and mother and Elder Mills bidding the show people to come into
the kitchen.&nbsp; He knew well enough what they were going to
talk about.&nbsp; His pa and ma were going to ask that poor girl
of them.&nbsp; The mountain people who had gathered, and who were
making themselves at home there in the clearing, seemed to guess
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>what was
in the wind.&nbsp; Jim heard his mother&rsquo;s friend, Mrs.
Leiter saying: &ldquo;It would be the best thing that could come
to the child.&nbsp; Mrs. McBirney would be a real mother to her;
and like as not the child would put heart into Mrs.
McBirney.&nbsp; She ain&rsquo;t never been herself a minute since
Molly was took.&nbsp; To my seeing, them show folks ain&rsquo;t
the kind to have charge of a child&mdash;particularly not a nice
little girl like that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By and by all of those who had been in the kitchen came out,
and Jim could see from the way they looked that they hadn&rsquo;t
been able to agree.&nbsp; His mother&rsquo;s face was whiter and
more strained than ever; and the light in the old elder&rsquo;s
eyes was really fierce.&nbsp; The show people seemed out of humor
and they went off by themselves and began cooking their dinner,
having nothing to do with the mountain folks.&nbsp; Jim had to
help his mother with her dinner then.&nbsp; She was asking the
neighbors to share with her, and the women all turned in to pare
potatoes and mix up corn bread and beat up eggs.&nbsp; There was
a busy hour or two, and then after all had eaten, a sort of quiet
settled on the gathering.&nbsp; They were waiting for the sun to
slide a little <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>further over the mountain, for the day was a very hot
one for May.&nbsp; It gave Jim a chance to slip around from place
to place, silent as a lizard and saying nothing.&nbsp; He wanted
to get acquainted with the show boy, and after what seemed a long
time, he found a chance to speak to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to come with me,&rdquo; he said in his
drawling, pleasant mountain voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you my
mill wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you make it?&rdquo; demanded the boy.&nbsp; He was
a queer, black little creature, who looked as if he had been
carved out of a nut.&nbsp; His arms were too long for his body,
but they were so strong that he could &ldquo;chin&rdquo; himself
on the low doorcasing of the shed without any trouble
whatever.&nbsp; Jim had already discovered that.&nbsp; He had
seen the boy hanging out on a long tree limb and dropping like a
cat.&nbsp; All of his ways were quick and sharp, and he had a sly
look like that of a half-fed hound.&nbsp; Jim never had seen a
boy like this and he felt shy with him.&nbsp; But for all of
that, he was determined to know him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed and I made the wheel,&rdquo; he said to the
boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;It runs right smart, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far away is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>&ldquo;Just down by the second waterfall.&nbsp; We
don&rsquo;t need to go &rsquo;round by the road.&nbsp; We can
drop right down the face of the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>So they slid down the sheer drop of the rocks till they came
to a place where the mountain stream widened out into a tiny
pool, and then, forced once more into a trough-like gorge, poured
on over the face of the rocks.&nbsp; Here Jim had made a mill
wheel on which he had worked many a day.&nbsp; The show boy
looked at it admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a right smart wheel,&rdquo; he
admitted.&nbsp; He stopped it with one of his dark, slender
fingers, and then started it again, and Jim&rsquo;s tongue
loosened, and he told him about all the other wheels he had made,
and why this was better than any of the others.</p>
<p>After a time they stuck their hot, dusty toes in the pool and
sat there watching the world.&nbsp; The sun and shadow raced over
the valley below; a hawk wheeled above their heads; little
creatures danced over the face of the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, please?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi Kitchell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s Jim McBirney.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>&ldquo;I know that already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are your folks with the show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sisson, he&rsquo;s my uncle.&nbsp; He runs the
show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you do tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, lots of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; And I do chores&mdash;do
more chores than tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you get paid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not regular.&nbsp; I get my board and keep.&nbsp; I
wish I could stay home with ma, and get some work to do in
town.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s four of us, and pa&rsquo;s dead, so my
uncle, he said he&rsquo;d take me off ma&rsquo;s
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go with a show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; cried the other.&nbsp; His nutlike
face seemed to grow old, and he looked at Jim from under his long
lashes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you like sleeping out in the rain,
picking up meals here and there, and going on day after day, no
matter how you feel?&nbsp; If the old folks take the notion,
that&rsquo;s what happens to a fella.&nbsp; And then the being
funny, that&rsquo;s the worst.&nbsp; I hate to be funny just
because folks have paid to see me that a-way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That girl, is she funny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny?&rdquo;&nbsp; The dark boy puzzled over this
quite a while.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about funny.&nbsp;
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>She&rsquo;s queer!&nbsp; Her ma was queer too.&nbsp; Not
a bit like the other women.&nbsp; She was good to me, and taught
me out of books and talked to me about my manners.&nbsp; And she
could make the people listen when she sang or danced, you
bet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that girl like the show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I reckon not.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no place for a nice
girl to be.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;ll keep her.&nbsp; The people
just clap and clap when she does things, she&rsquo;s so
&rsquo;cute, someway.&nbsp; Those other women, they&rsquo;re no
good.&nbsp; It would make you sick to see them trying to be
funny.&nbsp; And they&rsquo;re always wanting everybody to wait
on &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I tell you I&rsquo;m tired of &rsquo;em, and
so&rsquo;s Zalie, I expect.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll just be a slave to
them, that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;ll be, and she&rsquo;ll never
get a good word out of &rsquo;em neither.&nbsp; I wisht she could
stay here with your ma.&nbsp; If she could, then I&rsquo;d clear
out&mdash;run away and get a place in a mill or somewhere.&nbsp;
I tell you, I don&rsquo;t like drinking and roaming.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s too much like being a tramp.&nbsp; Good folks like
your pa and ma don&rsquo;t think nothing of us, I can see
that.&nbsp; And I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like it neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrinkled up his narrow forehead in a heavy frown, and Jim
frowned back as he tried to see things the way the boy was seeing
them.&nbsp; <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>He thought the boy very clever, and he knew that what he
said was true about the difference between people like his father
and mother, and the people like Sisson and his companions.</p>
<p>His mind seemed to go on sudden little journeys, and to show
him pictures of the wandering life Hi described, and of his own
safe home life.&nbsp; Then the faces and the language of those
men and women with the show helped him to understand.&nbsp; He
began to feel very sorry for Hi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a man&mdash;Rath Rutherford his name
is&mdash;who&rsquo;s going around the mountain getting folks to
go down and work in the cotton mills at Lee,&rdquo; he said after
a time.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;d take me if my folks would let me
go, and I reckon he&rsquo;d take you if you wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never could get away from my uncle&mdash;unless I ran
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hid,&rdquo; suggested Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nobody to stand by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes there is too!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stand by
you&mdash;sure I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ran away once and got caught and lambasted for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t get caught if I hid you,&rdquo;
declared Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides, you and me could
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>They
fell to planning what they would do if they were hidden and the
people came to get them, and they had to fight; or what would
happen if they came across a wildcat or a rattlesnake.&nbsp; They
got very well acquainted, and were almost ready to start off
together to &ldquo;take care of themselves,&rdquo; as Hi put it,
when a horn was blown from somewhere far above their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for me,&rdquo; cried Jim.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, we must go,&rdquo; and forgetting all about his plan
for running away, he began scrambling up the rocks toward
home.</p>
<p>He was really astonished to find that the afternoon had passed
and that the people were cooking supper within and without the
house, and he learned that Elder Mills had preached the funeral
sermon for &ldquo;poor Mis&rsquo; Knox&rdquo; and that there was
a fresh mound of earth beside Molly&rsquo;s little grave.</p>
<p>A wonderful golden light lay across the higher reaches of the
mountains, and below, the valley rested in deep purple
shadow.&nbsp; The martins were snug in their hanging gourds in
the crosstrees, and Jim could hear them making little sleepy
noises.&nbsp; It seemed so sweet there at home that he
couldn&rsquo;t bear to think of Hi going <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>on, and when
he heard the boy&rsquo;s uncle swearing at him because he had
left some chores undone, Jim hated Sisson.&nbsp; He thought what
fun he and Hi could have if they were allowed to prowl about and
cook their supper together.&nbsp; Jim knew how to build a fire,
and how to put it out.&nbsp; His father had taught him to take
care of the woods and to keep them from catching fire.&nbsp; Now
he came to think of it, he knew a great many things that he would
like to teach Hi.&nbsp; But he had to go in the house to his
supper, and he saw Hi being jerked along roughly by the arm and
heard the angry words his uncle said to him.</p>
<p>Within the house, Azalea was lying on the settle in his
mother&rsquo;s clean kitchen.&nbsp; She looked small and
white-faced, and her large eyes, which followed Ma McBirney
everywhere, were more than ever like &ldquo;Job&rsquo;s
tears.&rdquo;&nbsp; She came to the table when Ma McBirney called
her, but she could eat nothing&mdash;only drink a little of the
warm milk, and her hand trembled so that she could hardly hold
the cup to her lips.</p>
<p>And neither was Ma McBirney eating.&nbsp; Her face was white,
too, and her eyes full of trouble.&nbsp; Jim knew very well what
the matter was.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t bear to have this nice
little girl go away <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>in the company of &ldquo;bad folks&rdquo;&mdash;for that
was how Mary McBirney would call the show people.&nbsp; Almost
nothing was said while they were at the table, but when supper
was over Pa McBirney remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me and you&rsquo;ll wash up the dishes to-night,
Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t ma well?&rdquo; Jim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;s well enough, but she&rsquo;s got something
better to do,&rdquo; was all the answer he got.&nbsp; Pa began
washing the dishes, and Jim wondered why it was that he made such
a noise about it.&nbsp; Jim was told to build up more fire, too,
which seemed strange, for the room was quite warm enough.&nbsp;
But he did as he was told.&nbsp; The door stood open onto the
porch-like room, but no one could see in unless he came up on the
porch, for the solid wooden window shutters had been
closed.&nbsp; The fire set up a great crackling, and that and the
rattling of the dishes made it seem as if a great deal was going
on there in the room.&nbsp; But, really, not very much was going
on, for Ma McBirney and Azalea had slipped out of the back door
and had not come back again.&nbsp; Outside, the voices of the men
and the stamping <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>of the horses could be heard, and by and by some one
called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa there!&nbsp; Hulloa, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hulloa!&rdquo; answered Jim&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready to go,&rdquo; called the other
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Pa McBirney.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wish you luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the show women came up on the porch and looked in the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take that girl off your hands now,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and thank you for your trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble at all, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said pa
politely.&nbsp; &ldquo;A pleasure, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll just tell me where she is,&rdquo; Betty
Bowen went on, looking into the room and seeing no one there but
Jim and his father, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my impression,&rdquo; said pa slowly,
&ldquo;that my wife and the girl walked on down the mountain a
piece.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ll follow the road maybe you&rsquo;ll
catch up with &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bowen angrily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want that there girl and I want her quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t seem as if we did anything very quick up
here,&rdquo; said pa gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our way to
take our time about things.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>The
woman looked at pa and her face turned red.&nbsp; Then she said
some things that Jim wondered at, and after that she went for the
men.&nbsp; They came storming back, and Sisson wedged himself in
the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that girl, McBirney?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to rightly know,&rdquo; said pa,
with his slowest drawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your old woman, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know that, neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where one is, the other is,&rdquo; cried the
woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s stole that girl, that&rsquo;s
what she&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d have hard work a-stealing her,&rdquo;
objected Pa McBirney, &ldquo;when she don&rsquo;t belong to no
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out whether she belongs to anyone or
not,&rdquo; Sisson cried, shaking his fist at pa.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come it over us that way.&nbsp; We told
you that you couldn&rsquo;t have the girl and we mean
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said pa in his most reasonable voice,
&ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t took the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife has, and that&rsquo;s the same thing.&nbsp;
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>And
you&rsquo;ll have to give her up or there&rsquo;ll be
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What my wife does and what I do are two different
things,&rdquo; pa went on teasingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
telling you the truth when I say I don&rsquo;t know where them
women folks has gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sisson strode into the room at that, trembling with rage, and
as he did so, in at the rear door of the room lounged William
Sabin, one of the mountaineers, and behind him Tom Williams and
after him Dick Bab.&nbsp; Jim thought he saw other forms looming
up in the darkness without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, sonny,&rdquo; whispered Jim&rsquo;s father to
him, &ldquo;you just kind o&rsquo; slip out of that there window
above the bench till we get this little affair settled one way or
t&rsquo;other.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Jim, seeing that his father meant
to be obeyed, jumped on the wooden bench, loosed the catch of the
board shutter, and crawled out onto the pile of saplings that was
stacked against the outer wall.&nbsp; He could hear his heart
beating, and he tried not to think what might happen in the next
few minutes.&nbsp; He had heard of quarrels in mountain cabins
that ended in a terrible way.&nbsp; He wished in the bottom of
his heart that those show people had never come near them, and <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>that his
mother had never seen that girl.&nbsp; He could hear his
father&rsquo;s voice going on in its pleasant singsong way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These here friends of mine,&rdquo; he was saying,
&ldquo;thought to do a little shooting to-night.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve been put about by some spit cats hollering at night,
and we thought to get after &rsquo;em.&nbsp; But you
mustn&rsquo;t hurry away on that account.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
lots of time&mdash;all the time there is&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll
see you down the mountain a piece if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim heard Betty Bowen call:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, boys.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t worth it,&rdquo;
and then he saw Sisson and the others backing out of the
room.&nbsp; They got on their wagons, grumbling and swearing
among themselves, while the mountaineers came out and stood
watching them, the fire gleaming through the door upon the guns
they had brought to hunt the &ldquo;spit cats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I understand you to say that you&rsquo;d like our
company for a piece?&rdquo; drawled Pa McBirney as the show
people swung their lanterns beside their wagons and called to
their horses to move on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re mighty smart,&rdquo; yelled
Sisson.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you wait!&nbsp; Just you
wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>&ldquo;Kidnapper!&rdquo; sneered one of the women.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And your woman&mdash;looked too good to believe, she
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some mighty sharp turns on the
road,&rdquo; said pa politely.&nbsp; &ldquo;And maybe me and my
friends had best see you on the way.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got some
neighbors &rsquo;waiting for us a piece on.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d best
whistle for &rsquo;em, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if he whistled, it was not heard for the noise as the
wagons went rattling down the road.&nbsp; For a long time Jim
could hear the sound of the hoofs and the squeak of the brakes
and the angry voices of the show people.</p>
<p>Meantime, the mountain men had gone back into the kitchen and
lighted their pipes.&nbsp; They seemed to have but little to say
to each other, and Jim, peeping in at the door, was startled to
see each man lift his gun.&nbsp; But his father roared at them
and they dropped them with smiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to know where ma is,&rdquo; cried Jim,
running to his father.&nbsp; &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t any harm
coming to ma, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as I know of, son.&nbsp; Your ma&rsquo;s a smart
woman and a set one.&nbsp; When she wants to do a thing she most
generally does it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is she, dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t pre-cisely say,
son.&nbsp; All I know is she didn&rsquo;t mean for to let that
purty little girl go off with them wildcats.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
set her heart on keeping her in Molly&rsquo;s place, and
we&rsquo;ve set our hearts on having her.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was quite all.&nbsp; The mountaineers sat so that they
faced the two open doors and the one open window.&nbsp; They
appeared to be enjoying themselves after their fashion.&nbsp; Jim
looked out at the dark mountain side and the dense forest, from
which a strange whispering as of a thousand voices seemed to
come.&nbsp; He knew that wild creatures lived on that mountain,
and that terrible, sudden storms sometimes arose and raged over
it.&nbsp; He knew, too, how the trails crossed and recrossed each
other, and how unfamiliar they looked in the night.&nbsp; It
would be very easy for his mother to lose her way, for she kept
to the house much more than most of the women on the
mountain.&nbsp; He kept saying to himself over and over: &ldquo;I
hope she&rsquo;s safe; I hope she&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
aloud he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we was about it, I wisht we&rsquo;d a-taken that
there boy.&nbsp; He was a awful smart boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho!&rdquo; said pa.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wisht we had,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>CHAPTER III<br />
IN HIDING</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a little way farther now, dear.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s only a little way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little way to where, please ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Azalea gasped the question.&nbsp; She was spent with hard
climbing, and her heart pounded in her side.&nbsp; The steep path
before her was dark and rough.&nbsp; There was only the stars and
a small crescent moon to give them light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dare to carry a lantern&mdash;not
to-night,&rdquo; Ma McBirney had explained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to find our way in the dark this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to Azalea that it was hours since they began
&ldquo;finding their way.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had slipped out of
the back door of the cabin when the people were at their supper,
had crouched and crept along the path past the spring house and
taken a trail that ran up to the pine grove.&nbsp; From there on
they had been winding this way and that, always climbing and
climbing till the pain in the girl&rsquo;s side was almost more
than she <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>could stand.&nbsp; Ma McBirney seemed about ready to
drop too.&nbsp; Azalea could hear her breath coming almost in
sobs.&nbsp; Yet she pushed on, and when Azalea begged her to rest
she would only say: &ldquo;In a little while, my dear.&nbsp; In
just a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It began to thunder far off, and sheets of lightning threw a
strange pinkish glow over their path now and then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry none about that there
lightning,&rdquo; Ma McBirney said to the girl whose hand she
held so tight in her own that it hurt.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will swing
off around the mountain, like as not.&nbsp; Anyway we&rsquo;ll be
there before it comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, please ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked Azalea
again.&nbsp; And again Ma McBirney did not answer, but pressed on
along the path.</p>
<p>She seemed now to be walking on the very rim of a great bench,
and Azalea couldn&rsquo;t help feeling that if the people were
looking for them, they could see them standing out against the
sky when the lightning flashed over the mountain.&nbsp; Perhaps
Ma McBirney feared the same thing.&nbsp; At any rate, she stooped
over almost double as she walked.&nbsp; She could not hold
Azalea&rsquo;s hand as they crept along this narrow path, but she
<a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>told the
little girl to hold tight to her skirt.&nbsp; So they went on in
the rising of the wind, their way lightened by the increasing
flashes of lightning.&nbsp; Fortunately, though, they were
walking on ground that was almost level, and it gave their
pounding hearts a chance to quiet a little.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, Azalea saw looming up before her a great mass
of rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; cried Mrs. McBirney.&nbsp; She
began feeling around in the dark, and then, a great flash of
lightning showed something on the rock that was blacker than
either the night or the stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
the way in!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the girl, still holding onto that
motherly skirt, crept after Mary McBirney through an opening in
the rock, down three rude stairs, along a dark, damp place and
through another narrower opening.&nbsp; Ma McBirney struck a
match and lit a little lantern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here we
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea looked about her.&nbsp; Their feet rested on bare
earth, and on every side of them arose stone walls.&nbsp; From
them hung queer, mouse-like creatures and horrid spiders and long
beetles.&nbsp; Two benches of stone ran along the <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>side, and a
sort of fireplace had been made of broken pieces of rock, above
which a little crack in the roof served as chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t the first that has hid here,&rdquo; said
Mrs. McBirney looking around.&nbsp; &ldquo;And likely we
won&rsquo;t be the last.&nbsp; No one but mountain folk knows
about this place, and they ain&rsquo;t telling.&nbsp; Make
yourself to home Azalea, for this is where we&rsquo;re going to
stay till them friends of yours is tired of looking for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea drew up nearer to the woman and hid her face against
her bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, you little poor
thing?&rdquo; cried Mrs. McBirney.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
minding a few little bats and spiders, be you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
get them out in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; almost shrieked the girl.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch them, please!&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll fall
down on us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s this I hear?&rdquo; demanded
ma.&nbsp; &ldquo;A girl that&rsquo;s been plumb up against all
kinds of trouble, getting scared at a few little beasties!&nbsp;
You ain&rsquo;t seeming no ways brave to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But thousands of yellow spiders, ma&rsquo;am!&nbsp; And
hundreds of bats!&nbsp; All above our heads, too.&nbsp; I hate
it!&nbsp; I just hate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for the storm, dear, we&rsquo;d lie
on <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>the
ground outside,&rdquo; said Mrs. McBirney.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
there, there!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s come, you see.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve
got to stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke the wild downpour of the rain could be heard,
sweeping along over the mountain, and the next instant it was
roaring about them.&nbsp; They could feel the spray of it dashing
in from the outer chamber and here and there through crevices in
the rock above them.&nbsp; They seemed terribly alone there on
that mountain top in their resounding cavern, and Ma McBirney was
not surprised that the girl who had gone through such fearful
experiences that day should throw herself into her arms and
weep.&nbsp; Mary McBirney held her close and soothed her with
soft pattings and caresses.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t make her
voice heard above the storm, but she knew there were other things
besides words with which she could comfort the poor child.&nbsp;
They were both very tired.&nbsp; Their limbs trembled from the
long, hard climb and from the dread of the storm, and when Ma
McBirney spread her great circular cape on the ground they were
glad enough to lie down on it.&nbsp; They covered themselves with
it too&mdash;even their heads, and <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>after a little while, with the storm
still bellowing without, they fell asleep.</p>
<p>Jim and his father heard the uproar and turned in their beds
and shivered.&nbsp; In fact, Jim couldn&rsquo;t stand it in bed
alone, but crept into his father&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You reckon ma&rsquo;s hid somewhere out of this?&rdquo;
Jim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; cried pa, drawing Jim into bed beside
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sure she is.&nbsp; Her and that there girl is
as dry as a bone somewhere, sitting laughing at all this fuss of
rain.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when Jim had fallen asleep, soothed by
these words, Pa McBirney got up and walked the floor until
morning.&nbsp; Then he cooked Jim&rsquo;s breakfast and his own,
and packed a basket with food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-all will be taking a little stroll,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just hand me down my rifle, sonny.&nbsp; Maybe
we might see something we&rsquo;d like for dinner on the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went out of the back door, bidding Jim keep close beside
him, and looked around for quite a while before starting on the
up trail; and then he kept away from the wood trail and took the
one that led up the face of the rocks&mdash;one which no one but
a mountaineer could find <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>or follow.&nbsp; His footsteps
appeared on the freshly-washed earth only as far as the
spring.&nbsp; From there on, there was no trace of him and his
boy, and anyone who came looking for them would indeed have hard
work to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was talk of them show folks setting up the
merry-go-round and all the rest of the contraptions down there at
Lee to-day,&rdquo; said pa.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only hope
they&rsquo;ll do it and not go turning their attention to things
that don&rsquo;t concern them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once or twice as Jim and his father came out upon some rocky
ledge of the mountain the boy peered down into the valley to see
if he could catch sight of tents or wagons, but all below them
was wrapped in a wonderful lilac mist.&nbsp; And anyway, he had
not much time to give to these matters.&nbsp; He was thinking of
where his mother would be found, and wondering how it was that
his father kept such a sure course.&nbsp; Not an idea of where
his mother could be entered the boy&rsquo;s head, but he knew
there were secret hiding places on the mountains, of which
children were not told, and he was right in thinking that his
mother had gone to one of these.</p>
<p>After a long time he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you heading for, pa?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said pa, &ldquo;your ma thought best
not to tell me where she was going.&nbsp; She wanted me to speak
up truthful and say I didn&rsquo;t know her whereabouts.&nbsp;
But it wouldn&rsquo;t take many guesses for me to locate her in
Conscript Den.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Jim, staring at his
father with open eyes and mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a place that all the old folks about
here knows of very well.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been used by a good
many one time and another, but the first time I know of its being
used was when old Colonel Atherton tried to conscript a lot of
young men down there in Lee, to force &rsquo;em to join the
Southern army in 1862.&nbsp; Some of these here men was for the
Union and they didn&rsquo;t take to the idea of fighting with the
South.&nbsp; Anyway, I don&rsquo;t think they was much interested
either way.&nbsp; They just wanted to be left alone to work their
little farms and be let mind their own business.&nbsp; But they
didn&rsquo;t believe in slavery.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t in
&rsquo;em to do that.&nbsp; They was liberty loving people, and
if anything, a little too independent in their ways for their own
good, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so?&rdquo; said Jim.&nbsp; He had his own ideas
about independence.</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>&ldquo;So twenty young men that was conscripted run up
here and hid, and slipped down the mountain nights and got food;
and they picked berries and stoned rabbits and I don&rsquo;t know
what all.&nbsp; But even so they didn&rsquo;t have much and they
was almost skin and bone when the searchin&rsquo; party found
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when they found &rsquo;em, what did they
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa seemed not to have heard and walked on even faster than he
had been walking, which was quite unnecessary, for though Jim
could run along like a squirrel, he was almost out of breath
trying to keep up with his father.&nbsp; Now, however, he made a
dash and caught at his father&rsquo;s suspender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did they do with &rsquo;em dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They took &rsquo;em down to Lee, Jim, and stood
&rsquo;em up in the public square&mdash;them twenty young chaps,
some of &rsquo;em not more than eighteen&mdash;and their old
neighbors faced up there in double file and shot &rsquo;em
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had to, boy.&nbsp; <i>Had to</i>!&nbsp; Military
law.&nbsp; The old colonel made &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>&ldquo;But that finished him.&nbsp; He lived down there
in that big shut-up place they call The Shoals.&nbsp; You know
it.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t been opened in your day, but it&rsquo;s
a grand old house.&nbsp; Well, after the old colonel had made the
people do the thing I told you about, the countryside was up and
buzzing like a nest of hornets, and old colonel, he had to black
his face and put on women&rsquo;s clothes and hike out.&nbsp; And
his wife went back to Alabama where she come from, and nobody
heard of the Athertons any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are there any folks living at Lee now that did the
shooting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa McBirney stopped to get his breath, and he looked about him
at the lovely day, at the shining woods and the down-plunging
stream.&nbsp; Then he dropped on a convenient rock and motioned
Jim to sit beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-going to tell you something, Jim,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;that I want you to remember.&nbsp; Us mountain folks
has got a bad name in some ways.&nbsp; Folks say we&rsquo;re
shiftless&mdash;some of us&mdash;and revengeful.&nbsp; But do you
know what the people down at Lee done after old Colonel Atherton
was run out?&nbsp; They got together and they took an oath never,
no matter what come, to carry on <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>the story of that dreadful
thing.&nbsp; They said they wouldn&rsquo;t speak of it nor hand
it on to their children, nor wage war nor nurse hard
feelings.&nbsp; So who done the shooting and who was shot is
something I don&rsquo;t know and don&rsquo;t want to know.&nbsp;
My father knew, and what he knew turned him old before his
time.&nbsp; And I remember hearing about an older brother, and
never was I told about his end.&nbsp; So maybe your own uncle was
one of them poor martyrs.&nbsp; But it don&rsquo;t matter
now.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all healed up, like the hole the fire
burned in that there chestnut.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s healed up in
brotherly love, and if you was to go to Lee and ask any questions
about that there rumpus, you&rsquo;d get your trouble for your
pains.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d pretend they didn&rsquo;t know what you
was talking about.&nbsp; And the young people, they don&rsquo;t
know any more about it than just that it happened, and
they&rsquo;ve married and intermarried, till them that was forced
to be slayers and them that was slain have their names passed on
in the same family.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m proud of it, Jim, and
want you to know it, and to say to folks, when they hold out that
we&rsquo;re a quarrelsome people, that we&rsquo;re a forgiving
people too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim didn&rsquo;t answer.&nbsp; He sat close beside his <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>father for a
while, listening to the gentle sounds of the forest and the
falling water.&nbsp; And then the two got up and went on.</p>
<p>At length, amid a fine grove of chestnuts, Jim beheld the same
pile of rocks that had loomed up before the tired eyes of Azalea
the night before, and he followed his father around into a cranny
of them and saw the same doorway she had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; called pa softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mary!&nbsp;
Be you there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment there was no answer, and then, as he called
again, a frightened voice replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it you, Tom?&nbsp; Have you got a light?&nbsp; My,
it&rsquo;s dark here, and we&rsquo;ve been sleeping till
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim could hardly keep from whooping with delight, and the next
moment he and his father had crept through the first half-open
chamber, into the dark inner one, where ma and Azalea sat up on
the big coat, rubbing their eyes and blinking at the light from
the lantern which ma had blown out as they lay down to rest the
night before, and which pa had just relighted.</p>
<p>Jim never forgot the strange look of everything&mdash;of the
cave with its rough walls, of the <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>bats and spiders and beetles, of his
mother, sitting there on the ground, all bewildered and
strange-looking, and of the girl who clung to her and
shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of here!&nbsp; Get out of here!&rdquo; called
Pa McBirney cheerily.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine day
outside.&rdquo; And he helped his wife and Azalea to their feet
and led them outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best not build a fire,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to lie low a day or two till them show
folks get out of the way.&nbsp; I cooked the bacon before I come,
and I brought the coffee in a pail.&nbsp; It was hot when I
started, but I reckon it&rsquo;s cold enough now.&nbsp; But
here&rsquo;s plenty of biscuit, and a jar of gooseberry jam, and
some of them star cookies and some hard-boiled eggs and a few
radishes and some cold potatoes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness, Thomas!&rdquo; cried his wife.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did you think we had turned into wolves because we was
living in a den?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well you see, Mary, this here will have to last you all
of to-day and perhaps a part of to-morrow.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
telling just what will happen.&nbsp; I might be penned up down
there, with men watching me, and then you&rsquo;d want a little
stock of stuff laid by.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>Jim had
moved over toward Azalea, and now the two stood side by side
staring at the older people.&nbsp; Pa might be penned up, and ma,
who was hiding in a den, might go hungry!&nbsp; Did such things
really happen?&nbsp; Jim turned and gazed at the girl, and he
couldn&rsquo;t help thinking how pretty she was, with her oval
face and her great gray eyes and her long braids of brown
hair.&nbsp; She looked as if she could run as well as a boy and
ride a horse as well, or maybe better.&nbsp; Suddenly an idea
came to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he burst out.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
glad you&rsquo;re with us, ain&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
wish you&rsquo;d gone on with them other folks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad!&rdquo; said the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course
I&rsquo;m glad.&nbsp; I never want to see them again&mdash;never,
never!&rdquo;&nbsp; Her gray eyes turned almost black, and she
straightened her thin little figure till, in Jim&rsquo;s words,
she was like a ramrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; thought Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t like to get her mad at me.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
wouldn&rsquo;t be a good one to tease, Jim made up his
mind.&nbsp; Jim saw that his mother was watching the girl, too,
and he knew how his mother hated anything like bad temper and he
wondered if she would like <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Azalea as well when she saw that she
could be &ldquo;peppery.&rdquo;&nbsp; But all she said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Azalea, I know a place where there&rsquo;s a spring of
water.&nbsp; Pa&rsquo;s brought us a towel and some soap and a
comb.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll go down to the spring and make ready for
breakfast.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the two went off together, and Jim and
his father spread the breakfast out on a sort of table-rock.</p>
<p>Then they sat down to their breakfast, and whether it was the
strangeness of the night and the wildness of the place and the
beauty of the morning, or whether it was fun in its way, being
outlaws and in hiding, who can say?&nbsp; But as the meal went on
they began to laugh and talk as they seldom did even when there
was company; and Azalea couldn&rsquo;t keep from laughing
either.&nbsp; There was something hushed and sad about her face,
and when she spoke, her voice had a break in it, for her terrible
sorrow lay heavily upon her heart.&nbsp; Yet, as she had said to
Ma McBirney the night before, she had known for a long time that
her mother could not live, and she had thought how, after her
mother was gone, she herself must go on, taking the rough
treatment the show men had given her, and riding bareback on
those poor thin horses, and <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>doing tricks for people who called
out horrible things to her.&nbsp; Now she felt safe, and even
there in that wild place, more at home perhaps than she ever had
felt before in her life.</p>
<p>After a time Jim and his father went away, but not before they
had gone in the cave and killed or driven out every creature in
it.&nbsp; They made a sort of broom right on the spot before
Azalea&rsquo;s astonished eyes, and brushed the place and cleaned
it; and pa pried back a big stone on top and let the sunlight
in.&nbsp; And then he asked ma how she was going to put in her
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just sitting still,&rdquo; said ma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw you sit still yet, Mary,&rdquo; said
pa.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I can, Thomas.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you worry.&nbsp; I
can sit and sit and I&rsquo;m going to.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s years
since I&rsquo;ve had a quiet spell and it looks like this was my
time to take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing&rsquo;s believing,&rdquo; said pa.&nbsp; And
laughing and telling ma not to worry about anything, he and Jim
turned down the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get nearer the waterfall,&rdquo; said ma to
Azalea.&nbsp; So they went to a place where a great flat rock ran
out into the mountain stream, and here they sat with the water
tossing and leaping <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>past them and hurling itself over the side of the
mountain.&nbsp; Ma lay down and put her hands under her head and
looked straight up through the branches of an overhanging beech,
into the soft blue sky.&nbsp; And Azalea pillowed her head on her
arm and lay there too.&nbsp; A long time passed and neither
spoke.&nbsp; It was enough to listen to the voices of the
mountain, to watch the sailing of the clouds and the winging of
the birds.&nbsp; But after a time ma reached out and touched
Azalea gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little girl,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;little
daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a-thinking and a-thinking, and it seems
to me it&rsquo;s a queer world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m, it is,&rdquo; said Azalea as if she too
had settled that fact in her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some things that seem wrong is right, and some that
everybody&mdash;or almost everybody&mdash;says is right, is
really, when you come down to it, plumb wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s so, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, me taking you in the way I did&mdash;grabbing you
away from the folks you&rsquo;d known and been with&mdash;that
might look wrong.&nbsp; But it <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>ain&rsquo;t, Azalea, it
ain&rsquo;t!&nbsp; You want to know how I know it ain&rsquo;t
wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, first of all I reasoned it out.&nbsp; You was
better in a house than on the road.&nbsp; You was better living
where you could go to school than where you&rsquo;d slave for
people who&rsquo;d give you no education.&nbsp; You was better
with people who&rsquo;d take you to church and read the
Scriptures to you than with people who&rsquo;d swear and curse
and drink and gamble.&nbsp; And most of all, you was better with
them that would love and cherish you than with them that would
just use you, and perhaps bring you to some harm and turn you off
when they got through with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&rsquo;m!&nbsp; I know, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m thankful&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you bothering to be thankful,
Azalea.&nbsp; I just want you to be loving.&nbsp; But I
haven&rsquo;t said what I wanted to say.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t
reason that tells me I&rsquo;ve done right.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little pause, and then she went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something I wouldn&rsquo;t like to speak of
to everyone, Azalea.&nbsp; But you see, you&rsquo;re going to <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>take
Molly&rsquo;s place with me, and I&rsquo;m going to begin right
away treating you as if you was her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now this thing&mdash;its like a little bird
singing in my heart.&nbsp; Ever since I was a little girl, times
would come when that little bird would begin singing.&nbsp; Maybe
&rsquo;twould be a pretty day and me down washing clothes at the
spring; maybe &rsquo;twould be something preacher said in church;
maybe &rsquo;twould be Jimmy shouting and hollering out in the
woods, or his pa coming up the trail and letting out a yell to
tell me he was on the way.&nbsp; But when the bird sang best,
dear, was when I&rsquo;d done something that I knew I ought to do
and that it was hard to do.&nbsp; Now it was hard for me to take
you away from those folks, for I don&rsquo;t like to run counter
to no one.&nbsp; I like friends and I hate foes, and I had to
make foes of them people.&nbsp; But they wouldn&rsquo;t listen to
what was right and reasonable, and I had to do the way I
done.&nbsp; But all last night when we was climbing the trail in
the dark, and when the storm got us, and when we lay in that
filthy den, and most of all this morning when I woke up and found
you there beside me, the bird <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>was singing in my heart.&nbsp; It
sings sweeter than any of these here birds round about, though
they sing sweet enough, goodness knows.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s just
as if something new was come into the world&mdash;it&rsquo;s just
as it was the day Jimmy was born and lay on my arm and I knew I
had a little son of my own.&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s just the way it
was the day I found I had a Saviour, and learned that the love of
my Heavenly Father was round about me, and that I could walk in
it and fear nothing.&nbsp; Did you ever feel like that,
Azalea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned her great eyes on her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No&rsquo;m, I don&rsquo;t think I ever did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you will, Azalea, you will!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going
to tell you all about that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to tell you
every good thing I know.&nbsp; And you must tell me all you know,
too, for I&rsquo;m an unschooled woman, who&rsquo;s worked hard
and not seen much.&nbsp; But anyway, even for me, I can see that
life has trails that lead up the mountain.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
like to be here on the mountain top, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s the
most beautiful place I ever did see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and I was studying about your poor <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>ma.&nbsp;
Just think, to-day whatever there is to know over beyond life,
she&rsquo;s knowing.&nbsp; She was brave, wasn&rsquo;t she, and
kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m, Oh, yes&rsquo;m&mdash;good to folks and
animals and everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it will be counted to her.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just
got to be.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s happy and safe to-day; but maybe she
wouldn&rsquo;t have been happy if she couldn&rsquo;t have known
you was safe, too, Azalea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she knows, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she knows!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t sit here on this
mountain top and see them birds winging along and hear the wind
blowing and the water singing and have the little bird singing
away in my heart and not think she knows.&nbsp; Someway,
it&rsquo;s like two and two.&nbsp; When you add them they make
four.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t explain what I mean, but I&rsquo;m
trusting, Azalea, and I&rsquo;m happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her thin face shone with a beautiful light, and the eyes she
turned on Azalea were full of lovely tears.&nbsp; The girl crept
a little closer to her on the broad rock.&nbsp; The long day
passed in silence, to the humming of bees, to the shifting of
shadows, to the call of birds.&nbsp; They watched the sun set and
the stars rise.&nbsp; They felt the dew <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>fall on their
hands, and saw the blackness drop like soft veils.&nbsp; Again
they crept into their den, this time quite without fear, and
slept in each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>

69</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
NEW CLOTHES</h2>
<p>It was about sundown and Pa McBirney and Jim were sitting on
the porch of their cabin, feeling lonesome and deserted, when
Dick Bab, a bachelor who had a house about halfway between the
McBirney house and the foot of the mountain, came driving up on
his yellow mule.&nbsp; He grinned when he saw the two sitting
there, silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listening to the whippoorwills?&rdquo; he asked
teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; said Pa McBirney shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had your supper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you wouldn&rsquo;t have minded a little set-to
with them there show folks, would ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if they&rsquo;d come, I reckon we-all
wouldn&rsquo;t have run away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the neighbors thought I&rsquo;d better ride up
and let you know that there won&rsquo;t be nothing doing.&nbsp;
They was all hanging around looking <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>for a little amusement too.&nbsp; In
fact so many of them came down to see what kind of a lay-out them
folks had, that the show raked in a good deal of money&mdash;more
than they&rsquo;ve had for a long time, to all appearances.&nbsp;
Then Elder Mills, he spoke up and said he reckoned they&rsquo;d
made a pretty good thing out of this community and the best they
could do was to be a-moving on.&nbsp; He said so emphatic.&nbsp;
And the others spoke up and said they thought so too.&nbsp; So
that&rsquo;s the last any of us will see of that outfit.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve packed up bag and baggage, and if they had any idea
of coming up here and making trouble for you they concealed it
mighty well.&nbsp; So your missus may as well come out of hiding
and enjoy the comforts of her own rooftree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t show much spirit, did they?&rdquo;
asked pa in rather a disappointed voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much.&nbsp; But if they&rsquo;d showed more you
might have been punctured full of holes by this time.&nbsp; I
reckon it&rsquo;s better for your health the way it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like as not; like as not,&rdquo; said pa.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You &rsquo;light, Dick, and spend the night.&nbsp; Me and
Jim&rsquo;s bunking together, so you can sleep in Jim&rsquo;s
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you-all are wanting ma,&rdquo; said <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Dick.&nbsp;
And this time pa showed no resentment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we be,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
<p>So, the next day, about noon, down the steep trail walked Pa
McBirney with a forked stick in his hand.&nbsp; Behind him came
ma, who had had enough of &ldquo;sitting&rdquo; and was ready to
go to work again.&nbsp; After her came Azalea, whose feet seemed
fairly to touch the rocks and bound off again, and whose little
head turned this way and that with a birdlike way of trying to
see and hear all that there was to be seen and heard.&nbsp; Last
of all came Jim, his arms full of laurel blossoms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said ma, looking in at the door of the
cabin, &ldquo;If this here place don&rsquo;t look like a
hurricane&rsquo;d struck it!&nbsp; Azalea, you and me&rsquo;ll
have to straighten things up.&nbsp; We can change our dresses and
freshen up afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being a girl&rsquo;s hard luck,&rdquo; thought
Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;Me and pa can sit on the front porch I reckon,
while the women folks tidy.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he was mistaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you, Jim,&rdquo; called his mother in her most
businesslike tones, &ldquo;bring up fresh water from the
spring.&nbsp; Pa, I&rsquo;d like some more wood, please.&nbsp;
Azalea, you can be sweeping out.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>get over hot
water for the dishes.&nbsp; I thought you promised me, pa, that
you&rsquo;d keep the dishes washed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I do it then?&rdquo; said pa
despairingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I washed and washed and Jim wiped and
wiped till we about dropped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You drop pretty easy,&rdquo; answered ma.&nbsp; But she
was not scolding.&nbsp; Ma didn&rsquo;t waste much time in
scolding.&nbsp; There was always a laugh behind her words when
she said a thing like that.&nbsp; Jim felt a little cast
down.&nbsp; And he wondered if the new girl would think they had
to work like that all the time.&nbsp; He looked at her to see how
she was taking it, and he found her sweeping with all of her
might.&nbsp; True, his mother had to show her how to hold the
broom in the right way, and how long to take her strokes, but she
seemed to think it was fine to be able to sweep out, and it came
over Jim that up to now she probably hadn&rsquo;t had a house to
sweep, and no doubt she liked it.</p>
<p>But all the work seemed worth while when, at last, they sat
down at the table together.&nbsp; Ma had chopped up some salt
pork in beaten eggs, and had baked some potatoes in the ashes,
and made biscuit and a custard pie.&nbsp; And pa had <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>brought in
some fresh radishes and mountain honey; so there was a real feast
for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is lots better than a cave,&rdquo; Azalea said
shyly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lots better than the road
too.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was looking very odd in a dress of
ma&rsquo;s, which was worlds too wide for her, and which they had
tied in with an old blue ribbon.&nbsp; Her pretty, birdlike
little head came up out of all this cotton stuff like the head of
a frightened chicken out of its ruffled feathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get right down to the store,
Azalea,&rdquo; said ma briskly, &ldquo;and buy some stuff to sew
up for you.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t endure to have you looking that
a-way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, ma, couldn&rsquo;t Molly&rsquo;s clothes be fixed
up to fit Azalea?&nbsp; There might be some changing to do, but
you&rsquo;re so handy you could manage that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got a stitch of Molly&rsquo;s clothes
left,&rdquo; said ma rather sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you
think I&rsquo;d be doing?&nbsp; Letting them there good things
lie idle when they was needed by others?&nbsp; Molly
wouldn&rsquo;t have liked me to do a thing like that, would
she?&nbsp; I gave them all away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they would have come in handy now, ma.&nbsp;
Sometimes I think you&rsquo;re too impulsive.&nbsp; <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>You just go
and do whatever comes into your head to do right off
quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I do, Thomas; so I do.&nbsp; Soon as I laid eyes on
you I knew you was the man I wanted to live with for the rest of
my natural life, and when you asked me to marry you it
didn&rsquo;t take me a quarter of a second to say yes.&nbsp; Soon
as I saw Jimmy there, I knew he was the baby for me.&nbsp; Of
course he really was mine, and I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; had to
put up with him even if I hadn&rsquo;t liked the kind he was; but
it turned out he was the kind to suit me.&nbsp; It was just the
same with Azalea there.&nbsp; The minute I laid eyes on her, I
yearned over her, and I can tell just as well as if it was proved
to me, that she&rsquo;s going to be a comfort to all of us.&nbsp;
Yes, I&rsquo;m that way, Thomas, mighty impulsive and
quick-acting.&nbsp; Now, I&rsquo;ve just made up my mind that
to-morrow we&rsquo;ll all go down to Lee together and get what we
want for Azalea and show the folks what a united family we
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to go flaunting Azalea in the
faces of folks, do you, ma?&rdquo; pa protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know as I&rsquo;d use the word
&lsquo;flaunting,&rsquo; pa, if I was in your place.&nbsp; The
folks will be just crazy to see what she&rsquo;s like, <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>and after the
stand they took, hustling them show people out of the way and
all, and maybe saving your life by doing it, I think the least we
can do is to let them see that the girl was worth all the trouble
they took.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like as not; like as not!&rdquo; agreed pa.</p>
<p>That ma had other things on her mind was very certain.&nbsp;
She went poking over chests and drawers, searching for something,
and at last she came on some undyed homespun cotton of her own
weaving.&nbsp; She sat for several minutes with this on her
knees, looking at it.&nbsp; At last she called Azalea to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve half a mind to use that there blue dye
Mis&rsquo; Leiter brought over, to color this here, so&rsquo;s I
can run up a dress for you, Azalea.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t have you
go down to town looking like a scarecrow, and I &rsquo;clare to
goodness, I&rsquo;m prejudiced against having you go down in that
outgrown dress you had on when I saw you first.&nbsp; Why, your
arms and legs stuck out like the turkey legs on a platter.&nbsp;
It ain&rsquo;t fitten for you to go that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem like you have to go to an awful lot of
trouble for me, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; murmured the <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>girl.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And anyway, you couldn&rsquo;t get that done for
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma muttered something to herself which Azalea could not catch,
and the next minute Mrs. McBirney was away down to the spring,
building a fire, putting over a pot, and showing that she was in
for what Jim called &ldquo;one of her spells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When ma has a spell of work,&rdquo; he told Azalea,
&ldquo;nothing in this world can stop her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t have been more than an hour later that the
good, well-made stuff, dyed a rich, dark blue, was whipping on
the line in the wind.&nbsp; An hour after that it was pressed and
ready to be cut out; and before Azalea could realize what had
happened, ma was fitting the waist of a new dress to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always had a knack of snipping things out,&rdquo; she
told Azalea, &ldquo;and since I bought that there sewing machine
with my egg money, I can run a thing up in no time.&nbsp; As luck
will have it, I&rsquo;ve got some crocheted edging that will look
well on the neck and sleeves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A minute later she broke out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Azalea, you don&rsquo;t want hot, tight
sleeves coming down to your wrist, like you was <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>an old
woman!&nbsp; I keep my eyes peeled when I go down to Lee, and I
notice them girls at the hotel wears their sleeves about up to
their elbows.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say you want yours hiked up
quite that high, but we&rsquo;ll have them somewheres betwixt and
between, shan&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea nodded.&nbsp; She had little to say.&nbsp; She was
letting all the comfort of being there soak into her as rain
soaks into the thirsty earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then as to collars!&rdquo; broke in ma.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to see a girl with a nice, round little
throat, all choked up in a collar.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll cut this neck
out a little, to give you a chance to crook your neck around like
a young owl and look at the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the machine raced along over the seams and hems, and
the scissors snipped at raw edges, and ma&rsquo;s needle flew in
and out.&nbsp; It was left to Azalea and Jim to get supper, which
they did well enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll give you a chance to learn where everything
is,&rdquo; said ma.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jim, you show her the spring
house and the dishes and everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl had cooked over a camp fire more than once,
but she had never before set what Ma McBirney called &ldquo;a
nice table.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>However, she soon found out the way
that the McBirneys wanted things done, and meantime ma sewed on,
faster and faster.&nbsp; Her hair got roughed from sitting in the
wind, her hands were nervous and her eyes too bright, but she had
set her mind on doing that particular thing and nothing that
anyone could say to her would stop her.&nbsp; She was at the
buttonholes when the rest of the family crept into bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do any worrying about me,&rdquo; she
bade them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m better satisfied than I ever
thought to be again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they slept&mdash;Azalea on a little &lsquo;knockdown&rsquo;
that would have to serve till a place had been properly provided
for her&mdash;and when morning came, on the chair lay the blue
frock with its handmade edging, as simple and charming a little
gown as any girl in the country would care to wear.&nbsp;
Moreover, some faded ribbons had been dyed, and looked almost
like new.&nbsp; And there was clean underclothing&mdash;not quite
the right size, to be sure&mdash;and the old shoes had been
polished and made to look fit.</p>
<p>But if Azalea thought that everything was to be done for her,
and that she was to do nothing in return, she soon found out that
she was wrong.&nbsp; <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>Probably no such idea occurred to
her, for she was born with a loving heart, and she had learned to
serve.&nbsp; She was not surprised, therefore, when she found
that all of the family got up early and worked hard.&nbsp; There
were the animals to feed, the house to tidy, the water to bring,
the plants to water, the garden to weed.&nbsp; Nobody hurried,
exactly, but ma was not fond of &ldquo;lazy bones,&rdquo; and she
kept everyone going till all was as it should be.&nbsp; She
advised pa to drive the calf down to the butcher, and she had a
basket of eggs to get ready.</p>
<p>But at last all was done, and pa, with Jim beside him, sat on
the front seat of the wagon, and ma and Azalea sat in the back
seat, all clean and fine, ready to drive down the mountain.&nbsp;
The little calf was tied on behind.&nbsp; The hounds had been
shut up, and only the cat saw them off.&nbsp; The chickens and
guinea hens and turkeys could be heard away up in the brush, but
they concerned themselves very little with the comings and goings
of anyone.&nbsp; The martins were flying in and out of the
high-swung gourds, but they seemed to care as little as the
ground fowl.&nbsp; Neither did the little old house, basking
there in the sun, seem to mind.&nbsp; And <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>the graves
there, under the Pride of India trees&mdash;they minded not at
all.</p>
<p>So by steep and pleasant ways, underneath the chestnuts and
the hemlocks, the oaks and the mulberries, the tulip trees and
the poplars, the McBirneys, four in number, went winding on down,
down the road toward Lee.</p>
<p>They had not been an hour on their way before something
curious happened.&nbsp; There was a rushing in the bushes beside
the road which startled the horses and made Thomas McBirney take
the whip out of its socket to be ready for anything that might
arise.&nbsp; And the queer part of it was that the creature that
was making the noise, was running along, trying to keep pace with
the wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was one of the hounds broken loose, it would set
up a cry,&rdquo; said pa.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it ain&rsquo;t leaping
and jumping like an animal, nohow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea&rsquo;s heart beat hard.&nbsp; She thought that perhaps
it was, after all, a wild animal, and that maybe they would be
attacked.&nbsp; She was used to being on the road, but this part
of the Blue Ridge was wilder than that through which she usually
had traveled.&nbsp; However, there was not much time in which to
be frightened, for before <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>any one could realize what was
happening, Jim had leaped over the wagon wheel and plunged into
the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there, boy,&rdquo; yelled his father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ll be running
into.&rdquo;&nbsp; A shout of laughter reached him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be lammed!&rdquo; cried Jim.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be shingled, if it ain&rsquo;t Hi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;High!&rdquo; cried pa.&nbsp; &ldquo;How high?&nbsp;
What high?&nbsp; What you talking about, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Hi! it&rsquo;s Hi!&rdquo; Azalea
chorused, and in a flash she too was over the wagon wheel and in
the brush.</p>
<p>Pa turned an angry face around on his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be
them two children crazy?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>At that moment three children instead of two shot their heads
up above the dark green of the wild gooseberry bushes.&nbsp;
There was Jim&rsquo;s freckled, grinning phiz, Azalea&rsquo;s
long, lovely face, smiling, too, and the dark, odd little face of
the show boy, Hi Kitchell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of that?&rdquo; groaned pa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sneaked, pa,&rdquo; Jim explained at the top <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>of his
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;When them show folks lit out, he just
sneaked.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t he the &rsquo;cute one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, ma, are we going to start an orphan
asylum?&rdquo; pa asked under his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might do worse,&rdquo; answered ma.</p>
<p>But Hi was not an orphan, but a young man out for himself, and
after he had got into the wagon with the others and all were
rolling once more toward Lee, he made that plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went straight to Mr. Hitchcock at the mill,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;and told him I wanted to go to work.&nbsp; He
said he&rsquo;d take me on next Monday.&nbsp; Well, that was all
right, only I didn&rsquo;t have a cent in my pocket, but I
someway didn&rsquo;t like to tell him that.&nbsp; So I went down
town, looking around, and the funniest thing you ever heard of,
happened to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded the other four at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there was a gentleman come riding in on
horseback, and he had a little dog with him, a terrier.&nbsp; He
was an awful cute little dog, and when the man went in the post
office, I got to playing with him.&nbsp; The puppy didn&rsquo;t
know a trick&mdash;not a trick.&nbsp; Just plain ignorant, he
was.&nbsp; The man was in the office a long time, so I got to
teaching that dog some of the things he ought <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>to know, and
by and by the man come out and he see me, and he said I was
giving that there dog the kind of schooling he ought to
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho!&rdquo; said pa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he up and asked me where I lived and whose boy I
was, and I told him the whole story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was right,&rdquo; said ma gently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That was just what you ought to do, Hi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that gentleman said if I wanted I could come up to
his house and sleep in the barn, and have my meals at the house
till I got my first pay from the mill, all for teaching his dog
tricks.&nbsp; So I went up and I&rsquo;ve been staying
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to be there now,&rdquo; broke in
pa.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not so&rsquo;s you could notice it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; cried the boy, &ldquo;I had to come and
tell you-all, didn&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; I thought you-all would be
wanting to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do; sure we do,&rdquo; ma said, reaching forward to
pat the boy on the shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pa&rsquo;s just as glad
as any one, Hi.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you let him fool you, the way
he speaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see no especial reason for rejoicing that
a poor little boy is going to be shut up in <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>that
mill,&rdquo; growled pa.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t I heard the
whistles blowing at five, dark mornings and all, rousting them
young uns out of bed?&nbsp; And ain&rsquo;t I seen &rsquo;em
trudging home after dark come?&nbsp; All the day gone by, and no
good to them!&nbsp; No, you don&rsquo;t get no celebration out of
me over any child or chick getting in that there mill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, please sir,&rdquo; broke in Hi, in a kind of free
way he had, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you worry about me none.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m going in that mill, but I ain&rsquo;t going to stay
there&mdash;not unless I like it mighty well.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
going to get on, if I can.&nbsp; I want to get back to my ma, or
to have my ma and the kids come here.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m done
with that there show and that Weary Willie way of living.&nbsp; I
ain&rsquo;t going to trouble you none, don&rsquo;t you think
it.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t even come up to the house if you
don&rsquo;t want me to.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m thankful to you for
what you&rsquo;ve done for Zalie, and for what you done for her
poor ma, and it just come natural to tell you how I was getting
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you run along in them there bushes the way
you did?&rdquo; asked pa.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come
out fair and square and holler at us and let us know who you
was?&nbsp; Why, you like to scared my horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>Hi was
usually ready with an answer, but now he drooped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo; demanded pa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us, Hi,&rdquo; said ma gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just that I wanted to see you-all riding along,
with Zalie setting up there like she&rsquo;d been born in the
family,&rdquo; Hi explained, blushing.&nbsp; &ldquo;It done me
good to think that there she was, with nice people like you, and
her everybody&rsquo;s slave a day or two ago.&nbsp; I
hadn&rsquo;t ought to have done it, I know.&nbsp; But honest,
I&rsquo;ve got in some sort of sneaking way, having always to
dodge and hide and yarn to get on and have any peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa turned on Hi almost fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
do no more hiding, nor sneaking, nor fibbing.&nbsp; We-all are
friends to you, understand?&nbsp; You come up to we-all&rsquo;s
house like it was your own.&nbsp; Stick in the mill a
while.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t hurt you.&nbsp; Mr. Hitchcock&rsquo;s
a good man&mdash;good&rsquo;s he can be, I reckon.&nbsp; You
spend your Sundays with us.&nbsp; You can meet us at church and
ride up with us.&nbsp; Ma, what&rsquo;s happening to that there
fool calf?&nbsp; Acts like he knowed he was going to be
slaughtered, <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>don&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; Poor little critter!&nbsp; Say,
ma, you do the trading to-day&mdash;you and Azalea.&nbsp; Me and
Hi and Jim will walk over to the mill and have a little
talk.&nbsp; I want them overseers to know the boy&rsquo;s got his
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was really pa&rsquo;s way of getting out of facing his
curious neighbors at the stores.&nbsp; But ma felt no such
timidity.&nbsp; Her heart swelled with pride as Azalea leaped,
light as a kitten, from the wagon and turned to help Mrs.
McBirney down.&nbsp; Ma nodded right and left to the people
gathered to do their Saturday &ldquo;trading,&rdquo; and she
introduced Azalea, in her gentle, singing voice, to the women and
girls who came up to meet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my girl,&rdquo; she would say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Azalea McBirney.&nbsp; Come, Azalea, let&rsquo;s go in and
see if they have something that&rsquo;ll do for the makings of a
dress.&nbsp; How&rsquo;d you like a green gingham&mdash;pale
green you know?&nbsp; And that there white barred stuff
ain&rsquo;t but fifteen cents a yard.&nbsp; How d&rsquo;ye do,
Mr. Constance?&nbsp; Pretty day, ain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Do you
reckon you could take these here eggs and let me do a little
trading with you?&nbsp; Yes, this is the girl.&nbsp; You can call
her my girl, when you&rsquo;re speaking of her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
like to get her <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>outfitted here at your place if you&rsquo;d be so kind,
Mr. Constance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea stood facing her new world, so to speak, and on every
face she saw welcome.</p>
<h2><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>CHAPTER V<br />
THE SHOALS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; cried Azalea, &ldquo;my room&rsquo;s done
at last.&nbsp; Come see it, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked at that room and looked at it.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s any different from what it was
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;James Stuart McBirney, it is too!&nbsp; Ma&rsquo;s hung
a blue curtain over the place where my clothes hang, and
she&rsquo;s got a braided rug on the floor and a cheesecloth
curtain at the window, and she&rsquo;s covered my stand with blue
and white print.&nbsp; The way she&rsquo;s fixed up those cones
and pine leaves, you&rsquo;d never know the looking glass was
broke.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the prettiest room I ever saw.&nbsp; Oh,
Jim, do come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim pretended that he wasn&rsquo;t interested, and stamped up
the new stairs his father had built, and along the platform which
led to the attic room which had been given Azalea for her
own.&nbsp; Although Jim was supposed not to care anything about
the room, he had, nevertheless, braided a <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>hammock of
warp such as his mother used on her loom, and this hammock had
been swung out on the platform.&nbsp; Azalea could lie there and
look straight up the mountain side.&nbsp; Jim had helped, too,
with the making of the bedstead and the splint-bottomed chairs
and the dresser, and in the bottom of his heart he thought it was
just the kind of a room Azalea ought to have&mdash;she was so
pretty and&mdash;well, Jim couldn&rsquo;t quite find the word to
describe her&mdash;but she reminded him of a pinky-white
trillium.&nbsp; Not that he would have said so.&nbsp; He treated
her just as if she had been his own sister, and that means that
he led her rather a hard life at times.&nbsp; But that
didn&rsquo;t seem to bother Azalea at all.&nbsp; She would do
anything for him, and she could tease back when she had a mind
to, and when he &ldquo;got her in a corner,&rdquo; as he put it,
she laughed her ringing laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some girls would get mad to be treated the way Jim
treats Azalea,&rdquo; ma used to say.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
she&rsquo;s got the sweetest disposition of anybody I ever
saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too sweet to hold her own,&rdquo; answered Thomas
McBirney.&nbsp; &ldquo;At first I thought to myself, have to
pitch in and take that girl&rsquo;s part, <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>but after a
time I says to myself, I reckon I&rsquo;ll leave them two young
uns to take care of theirselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They used to buy each other to do things, by promising to tell
stories.&nbsp; If Jim wanted Azalea to help him gather firewood,
he offered to tell her a story in payment for her help.&nbsp; If
Azalea wanted Jim to help her scrub the floor, she promised him a
story of things that had happened to her when she was &ldquo;on
the road.&rdquo;&nbsp; One day Jim told Azalea the story his
father had told him that day on the mountain, about the old
Atherton mansion, and how it had stood vacant for years and
years, with the swallows flying in and out its chimneys, and the
snakes and squirrels and birds having their way with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s snakes in the grass and bats in the
porches and wild doves in the barn,&rdquo; said Jim.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A boy I know told me about it.&nbsp; He says you
can&rsquo;t count the squirrels and the catbirds and the robins
and the thrushes.&nbsp; Some think it&rsquo;s haunted, but I
don&rsquo;t reckon there&rsquo;s much in that story.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not long on ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have a ghost,&rdquo; said Azalea
wistfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;d like to see
it&mdash;the house, I mean.&nbsp; Oh, Jimmy, I&rsquo;d just love
to see it!&nbsp; <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>Let&rsquo;s ask ma if we-all can&rsquo;t go picnicking
down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma was doubtful.&nbsp; She said she&rsquo;d fooled away
altogether too much time lately&mdash;that she&rsquo;d never been
so lazy.&nbsp; But at this her whole family laughed so, for they
almost never caught her for a moment idle, that she gave in and
agreed to go the next Saturday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa&rsquo;ll be driving to town, and we-all will go
along.&nbsp; We can get out at the Old Green Place and cut off
across to the Atherton Place and eat our lunch there, and then
pa, he can meet us at the Green Place again on the way home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The road to town used to run by the Atherton
house,&rdquo; pa said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it did seem as if it
picked up every hill in the whole county, and now that the road
ain&rsquo;t been taken care of for a dozen years, it&rsquo;s just
a pesky lot of sink holes.&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s as much as a
horse&rsquo;s life is worth to take it over that there
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saturday morning came with the bluest of skies.&nbsp; Little
soft white clouds floated over it like happy ships on a sea; and
the wind was playful, too, and the sunshine friendly.&nbsp; The
four got off very early and rattled down the mountain side in a
manner to take the breath <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>away from anyone who had not perfect
confidence in Pa McBirney&rsquo;s driving.</p>
<p>At last the &ldquo;Old Green Place&rdquo; was reached, and ma
prepared to get out with the children.&nbsp; But pa objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, I don&rsquo;t think this is a fair deal,
ma,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Me going off all by myself,
eating my lunch alone in this tarnation old wagon, and you three
picnicking!&nbsp; You come along with me, ma.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
fit to do trading by myself.&nbsp; You know you&rsquo;ve often
said that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma made a face at him, for she knew he had her there, but she
really did think it rather dull for pa to drive on alone seven
miles to town, and so, after she had made the children promise
that they would be careful about this, that and the other thing,
and be at the Green Place in the middle of the afternoon, she
went on to Lee with pa.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p92.jpg">
<img alt=
"&ldquo;She ran out to meet me,&rdquo; he cried"

</a></p>
<p>The two children turned their faces down an unknown road,
overhung with great chestnuts and lindens, and cut into deep
gulleys by the rains.&nbsp; The way looked lonely and beautiful
and strange and Azalea felt her heart beating a little faster
than usual.&nbsp; She was just going to say to <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Jim that
they&rsquo;d probably get lost, when something ran swiftly across
their path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An adder!&rdquo; cried Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;A gray
adder!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the poisonest snake that lives anywhere
here about.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you go fooling with snakes like
that, Zalie, whatever you do.&nbsp; Why, once I teased a gray
adder till he got so mad he bit himself.&nbsp; And in three
minutes he was dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest!&nbsp; You say you&rsquo;re sorry for
snakes&mdash;I like &rsquo;em to kill!&mdash;but don&rsquo;t you
fool none around an adder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t try to kill that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I hadn&rsquo;t been going for a good time, I
would.&nbsp; Somehow, when I&rsquo;m going out for a good time, I
don&rsquo;t like to begin by killing something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea laughed lightly, and the two went on along the shady
road.&nbsp; Twice they crossed creeks&mdash;amber-colored,
rippling streams that sang over the stones.&nbsp; One they jumped
across; the other was too wide for that, but they found a narrow
swinging bridge a little way upstream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t it seem strange to think that there used to
be people and people going along here,&rdquo; <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>mused Azalea,
&ldquo;and now almost no one comes here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim nodded.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t much time to think about
things like that.&nbsp; He was wondering what he would find at
the Atherton house.</p>
<p>After a time they came to a sunny piece of road, and along the
side a clay bank punctured with little holes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, doodle bug holes!&rdquo; cried Jim.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s get the doodle bugs out.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
the two children got down on their knees and blew into the holes
where the bugs lived and called three times:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doodle bug, come out of your hole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the doodle bugs came out politely, and ran about this way
and that as if looking for the person who had called them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spose we&rsquo;re too large for them to see,&rdquo;
said Azalea.</p>
<p>They had been told to keep their lunch until noon, but they
felt so hungry&mdash;at least Jim did&mdash;that they decided to
eat it at once.&nbsp; So they got out the cold biscuit spread
with honey and the bottle of milk and the cornbread sandwiches
with the bacon between and ate it all.&nbsp; Not a scrap did they
leave.&nbsp; Then they took a long drink of spring water and
started on again.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said
Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;By noon we&rsquo;ll be hungry again, and by
four o&rsquo;clock we&rsquo;ll be starved to death.&nbsp; Pa and
ma will come along and find two heaps of bones at the Old Green
Place, and they&rsquo;ll never know it&rsquo;s us, and
they&rsquo;ll go up the mountain weeping and gnashing their
teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked at her admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you think of so many things to
say, Zalie.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think of things to
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take me along with you wherever you go,
Jimmy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>At last they got in sight of the Atherton estate.&nbsp; Jim
saw it first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look there!&nbsp; Look there!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did you ever see such hedges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ran through the trees, then along beside the great hedge
as far as the gateway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the gates are open, ain&rsquo;t they,
Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, they are!&nbsp; Now what do you think of
that?&nbsp; Zalie, there&rsquo;s smoke coming out of the kitchen
chimney&mdash;and the grass is cut.&nbsp; And, look there, a man
is painting the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s folks living there, Jim.&nbsp; Maybe
it&rsquo;s ghosts&mdash;like I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>&ldquo;No it ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I smell the paint.&nbsp;
And that&rsquo;s old man Hendricks doing that painting.&nbsp; It
wouldn&rsquo;t be right to holler to him, would it,
Azalea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The folks might hear you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s queer pa
didn&rsquo;t know folks had moved in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, pa ain&rsquo;t been to town for three weeks, and
anyway, he might not come on anybody that would tell him.&nbsp;
Lots of rich folks comes to Lee now.&nbsp; They come down there
because they think it&rsquo;s pretty.&nbsp; That don&rsquo;t seem
much of a reason for coming to a place, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon that&rsquo;s why your pa and ma stopped
away up on Tennyson mountain, Jim.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t no way
convenient to anything&mdash;just way off by itself.&nbsp; If it
wasn&rsquo;t that they stopped on account of prettiness, what was
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&nbsp; Pa wouldn&rsquo;t stop nowhere for
prettiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he would!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll just bet he
would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I know pa better than you do, Zalie.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve known him years, and you&rsquo;ve known him
weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t the length of time you know a person
that counts, Jim.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the looking in at their hearts
and the understanding of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re pretty smart, don&rsquo;t
you?&nbsp; Knowing my pa better than I know him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim, see!&nbsp; A girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their little pretense at quarreling&mdash;for it was only a
pretense&mdash;was stopped by the appearance of a little girl on
the portico of the great house.</p>
<p>She looked quite small to them at first, standing among the
great pillars that ran up the front of the house, but as she
walked on down the old brick walk toward the gateway, they saw
that she was almost as tall as Azalea, and quite a little
heavier.&nbsp; She was all russet brown&mdash;hair, eyes, frock,
stockings and shoes, and in her arms she carried a little silky
dog with long ears and wistful, bulging eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to go away,&rdquo; whispered Azalea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no business to stand staring in at other
folks&rsquo;s yards like this.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t
polite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though she said this, she did not move an inch, and as for
Jim, he stood with his mouth open, watching that girl dance down
the long brick walk between the box hedges.</p>
<p>Suddenly she saw the children and stopped.&nbsp; Her eyes
rested on Jim a moment and she seemed to smile at his kind,
freckled, jolly phiz.&nbsp; Then <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>she saw Azalea and the look in her
face changed to one of deeper interest.&nbsp; Azalea, standing
slender and straight there in her clean blue frock, with her gray
eyes shining and her long hair beautifully braided, certainly was
good to look at.&nbsp; So the girl came on, not dancing now, but
hastening along as if bent on business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; she said sweetly, blushing a
little with shyness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very well, thank you,&rdquo; said
Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim made a noise in his throat to show that he meant well, but
no one could tell what words he was trying to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you live near here?&rdquo; the little girl
inquired.</p>
<p>Jim pointed over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We come from up mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not brother and sister!&rdquo; exclaimed
the girl.</p>
<p>Jim wondered what Azalea would say.&nbsp; He was very proud of
her.&nbsp; She seemed to him like a humming bird that had come to
live among wrens, and he wondered if she would be ashamed of
him?&nbsp; He was a happy boy, who wasted no time in thinking
about uncomfortable <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>things, but now, suddenly it came over him that he was
rather a stupid chap, with trousers that were too long for him,
and a waist that was too short in the sleeves, and bare feet and
a freckled face.&nbsp; Azalea&rsquo;s clothes were new, and
anyway, his mother knew much more about dressing girls than she
did about dressing boys.&nbsp; And then no matter how he dressed
or how he tried he never could look like Azalea!</p>
<p>She was speaking now, and he put aside his thoughts to
listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s father and mother took me in,&rdquo; she
was saying softly, &ldquo;and they treat me like I was their
own.&nbsp; My mother died just a little while ago, and my
father&mdash;well, I never saw him at all&mdash;and now I say my
name is McBirney, just like Jim&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s James
Stuart McBirney.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m Azalea&mdash;they let me be
called Azalea McBirney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was beautifully done&mdash;lovingly done.&nbsp; Her
pleasant voice caressed the words, her gratitude put a little dew
into her eyes.&nbsp; The other girl stood listening and looking
and &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; Then she looked at Jim and
smiled and said &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; once more.&nbsp; And after that
she murmured, &ldquo;Azalea!&nbsp; How pretty!&nbsp; My name is
<a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>Carin
Carson, and we&rsquo;ve just moved here.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
anyone and I&rsquo;m dreadfully lonesome.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t
you come in and play for a little while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Azalea, &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose we
could.&nbsp; We really came down here to see this house, but we
didn&rsquo;t know anyone was living in it.&nbsp; We thought it
would be such fun to see a house that no one had lived in for
years and years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&nbsp; Why, so did I.&nbsp; And so did papa and
mamma.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a beautiful old house, isn&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; We find something new about it almost every hour.&nbsp;
Why, this morning what do you think we found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret staircase!&nbsp; Yes, we did.&nbsp; It runs up
from a sitting room in that far wing to a bedroom above.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no door you can see&mdash;only panels that slide in
the wainscoting.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more fun!&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t
you like to see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just love to see it.&nbsp; But your
ma&mdash;would she like us to come in?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
believe I&rsquo;d like to come in unless your ma said we
might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> particular,&rdquo; laughed
Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must have been very strictly brought
up.&nbsp; <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>I&rsquo;ll go ask my mamma, if you&rsquo;ll wait a
minute.&nbsp; Come in and sit on this bench.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And without waiting to see them seated under the
wide-branching plane tree, she sped away up the walk.&nbsp;
Azalea looked after her rather gloomily.&nbsp; What would this
nice girl say if she knew that Azalea had been brought up with a
traveling show&mdash;a miserable show, with coarse, profane men
and women in it?&nbsp; And then she remembered, how, though her
mother was one of them, and always seemed to want to stay with
them and was frightened if any people from the towns tried to
know her, yet her mother had been different from the
others.&nbsp; And coarse and mean as the show people had been,
they were nevertheless afraid of what she would think of them, in
a way; and Azalea knew that no unkind or unlovely word ever had
passed her lips.&nbsp; She had been most careful about her
daughter&rsquo;s manner and language, and as a matter of fact,
Azalea knew how to use much better grammar than she usually
employed.&nbsp; She talked carelessly because the people around
her did so, and because she didn&rsquo;t want to seem a bit finer
than dear Pa and Ma McBirney.&nbsp; Whatever they said, somehow
sounded right to her.</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>In a
moment or two Azalea saw Carin coming back with a tall, slender
lady.&nbsp; The lady was dressed in white and wore a white scarf
that drifted back from her shoulders.&nbsp; Even her shoes and
her parasol were white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ghost, if there is one, I
reckon,&rdquo; whispered Jim.&nbsp; Azalea arose as the lady drew
near and bowed politely, and Jim did the same, because he saw
Azalea doing it.&nbsp; The lady shook hands with them when Carin
had introduced them, and talked with them a little while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fortunate it is,&rdquo; she said in a fluty voice,
&ldquo;that you and papa and I bought this house before Jim and
his sister saw it, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; They&rsquo;d have got it
away from us I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;&nbsp; She laughed lightly
and looked down at them with large, warm brown eyes like her
daughter&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she went on,
&ldquo;since we were the lucky ones, Carin, the only thing we can
do is to show them our treasures.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she led the
way back to the house.&nbsp; Carin gave a little skip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think she&rsquo;s a dear?&rdquo; she
whispered to Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the sweetest mother
in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea had a vision of her own tired, frail little mother in
her silly show dresses, smiling and <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>bowing to the crowds of common
people that came to hear them, and she shivered as if a chilly
wind had blown over her.&nbsp; Yet her mother might have looked
as beautiful as this lady, she thought, if she could have walked
about a lovely garden with a scarf like a cobweb floating from
her shoulders.</p>
<p>They were taken into the wide hall which ran straight through
the house and showed a garden in the rear, where a fountain
played; and through the long drawing room, where as yet there
were only piles of heaped-up furniture, then into a gay little
room Mrs. Carson called the morning room, where bright birds were
pictured on the curtains and the chair backs; and then into the
sitting room in the far wing, where servants were putting
hundreds of books on the shelves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me show them, mother!&rdquo; cried Carin, and she
ran forward to a piece of the high paneling which was not
occupied by book shelves, and pushed a little spring, and whish!
back into the casement flew the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look up!&nbsp; Look!&rdquo; said Carin, dancing about
in her delight.&nbsp; Azalea ran forward and looked up the dark
narrow stairs.</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>&ldquo;Who do you see coming down?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Carson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tall old man, with stooped shoulders and a dreadful
frown,&rdquo; said Azalea.</p>
<p>At that, Jim looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Zalie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see
anyone!&rdquo;&nbsp; Azalea was going to laugh, but she saw that
Carin and Mrs. Carson didn&rsquo;t laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only our nonsense, Jim,&rdquo; the lady said
smilingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t one of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at her two visitors for a moment.&nbsp; Jim was
inquisitive.&nbsp; He wanted to know all there was to know.&nbsp;
He was out gunning, so to speak, for facts.&nbsp; Azalea was
wandering along hoping to meet with fancies.&nbsp; She was the
one with the imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which I like best,&rdquo; thought
Mrs. Carson.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure they make a good
team.&rdquo;&nbsp; Aloud she said: &ldquo;What do you think of
lunch in the garden?&nbsp; Everyone in the house save us is as
busy as busy as can be.&nbsp; Shall we get our own
lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, hardly believing that it could all be true, Jim and his
sister went with Mrs. Carson and Carin into the great cool pantry
and helped spread the thin slices of bread, and to cut the <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>cheese and
dish the honey and slice the cold chicken.&nbsp; And then they
sat where the cucumber oleanders shed their fragrance, and the
sound of the fountain whispered in their ears, and ate and talked
and laughed together.</p>
<p>Afterward they explored the garden and the barn&mdash;at least
the children did&mdash;and then the hour came for the McBirneys
to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I see your mother?&rdquo; asked Azalea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;s resting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go see,&rdquo; Carin said.&nbsp; Mrs. Carson
came back with her and smiled upon the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy days, happy days!&rdquo; she sighed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to be as young as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly have been happy, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
Azalea said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been so good to us, and
we&rsquo;re just strangers.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see how you could
be so good when you didn&rsquo;t know us or anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;A few years ago
something happened to me which made me decide to be happy
whenever I had the chance, and to make other people happy in the
same way.&nbsp; I saw you and wanted to know you.&nbsp; Carin
wanted to know you.&nbsp; You wished to see our home.&nbsp; It
was the kind of a home you would have picked <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>out for
your own if you could.&nbsp; It was the merest accident that I
had it and you didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Very well, I&rsquo;ve shared
it with you.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; Come again, come again!&nbsp; We
keep open doors at The Shoals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea got away somehow, her heart dancing with
gratitude.&nbsp; Jim followed.&nbsp; They were late, and they ran
along the uneven, shady road.&nbsp; Pa and Ma McBirney were
already at the &ldquo;Old Green Place,&rdquo; a little tired of
waiting but very good-natured notwithstanding.&nbsp; So, since
everything was going well it seemed a little odd that Azalea
should put her head down in Ma McBirney&rsquo;s lap and softly
weep.</p>
<p>Never did Azalea love this dear woman more than when she found
that she was to be allowed to weep if she liked without being
asked why.&nbsp; Mary McBirney stroked the soft hair and said
nothing&mdash;was most careful in fact, not to call the attention
of Jim and his father to her outburst.&nbsp; At last Azalea
lifted her face, tear-stained and smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so happy,&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When we get home I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&nbsp;
Everything seems different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim had been rattling on to his father on the <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>front seat,
and Mrs. McBirney, who had managed to catch a part of what he was
saying, had some idea of why the world seemed different.&nbsp;
She, herself, thought that Azalea, the daughter of the wandering
show woman, was really meant for a beautiful life like that of
the Carson&rsquo;s, rather than a life of work and poverty and
hardship like her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll give her what I can,&rdquo; she
thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give her love.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
GROWING PAINS</h2>
<p>That night Mary McBirney carried the candle up to the loft for
Azalea and sat beside her while she undressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you feel a little upset, honey,&rdquo; she
said in her gentle, motherly way.&nbsp; &ldquo;You saw them grand
folks with their fine ways, and beautiful home, and nice clothes,
and it made you feel you wasn&rsquo;t nobody.&nbsp; I know just
how you feel.&nbsp; I was born up Blue River Valley way, and till
I was fifteen I didn&rsquo;t see nobody but folks of the same
kind as mine.&nbsp; Then two ladies came driving through our
country, writing up us mountain people, and telling all about the
mountains and what trees and flowers was on &rsquo;em, and they
asked me to go along to do the cooking for them, and shake down
their beds for &rsquo;em and all that.&nbsp; So I went, and set
up on the front seat of the carriage with the driver, and I heard
all they had to say, and watched their way of doing things.&nbsp;
Well, it set me back some.&nbsp; I found out <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>that what I
knew wouldn&rsquo;t fill the thimble point of their
knowing.&nbsp; They was wearing rough clothing for camping, but
if I tried all my days I couldn&rsquo;t make clothes look like
that.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to buy them if I had the
money.&nbsp; Me, I just did things anyhow, to get them done, but
they had a right way for everything and rules about how to act in
every kind of case.&nbsp; At first I tried to catch on to their
ways, but at last I saw it was going to be too much for me, and I
just settled down to be content in my own way with my own kind of
folks.&nbsp; But my pillow was wet many a night, honey.&nbsp;
Growing pains, they were.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re having them
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so is Jim, I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; sighed the
girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose he feels the same way&mdash;all
mixed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t feeling nothing like you be,&rdquo;
declared ma.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s a boy, and matter of
fact.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a leetle older than you, really, but not
near so old in his feelings.&nbsp; Jim saw what there was to see
on top&mdash;saw what was floating along the surface.&nbsp; But
you think and feel in a different way, and your feelings go down
deeper.&nbsp; Now mind, I don&rsquo;t say that I think they
always will.&nbsp; Jim&rsquo;s tender and he&rsquo;s true, and
when men are tender and true they feel deeper than any woman <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>can
feel.&nbsp; At least no woman can get ahead of them that
way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m waiting for Jim to get a little older before
his feelings set, so to speak.&nbsp; Just now he ain&rsquo;t got
any more opinions than a nice soft bunny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ma,&rdquo; cried Azalea, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
really know him if you think that!&nbsp; Jim does a lot of
thinking, and he&rsquo;s as tender-hearted as he can
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma McBirney blew out the candle and smiled to herself in the
dark.&nbsp; She loved to hear her Jimmy praised.&nbsp; But he had
seemed a little dull and backward in comparison with the girl,
and in her silent jealousy for her boy, she had spoken of him in
a fault-finding way.&nbsp; It healed her to hear him praised in
that warm manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lucky ones, Thomas,&rdquo; she said when
she had gone downstairs, &ldquo;to have two children like
them.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re pure gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they be,&rdquo; said pa.&nbsp; &ldquo;So they
be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he and ma walked silently out to the Pride of India
tree beneath which their Molly and Azalea&rsquo;s mother were
buried, and stood there a few minutes before they closed up the
house for the night.</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>The
next week when pa went to town, he brought back great news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them there Carsons down in the Atherton house,&rdquo;
he said to his family at supper, &ldquo;are up to the greatest
things you ever heard of.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re making all the
mountain folks welcome, and buying up their pieced bedquilts and
their hand-weaving, and their baskets and chairs.&nbsp; Why, Mr.
Carson, he and me was made acquainted by the grocer, and he asked
me if I done anything in the way of hand work.&nbsp; Well, I
allowed I made pretty good chairs, and he told me to bring down
half a dozen big roomy ones for his porch.&nbsp; He said like as
not some of his friends would want some too.&nbsp; Then I told
him about your weaving and he said he&rsquo;d like to drive his
wife up to see it.&nbsp; Said he&rsquo;d like to look over our
place.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d been telling him how sightly it was.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve got everybody humping.&nbsp; Cannaby&rsquo;s making
roads for him, and Fletcher&rsquo;s making shoes, and he&rsquo;s
buying up fine hens&mdash;wants some of my guinea hens&mdash;and
he&rsquo;s looking for a good cow, and I don&rsquo;t know what
all.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t seen things so lively down street since
I can recollect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he comes up, he&rsquo;ll bring Miss Carin, <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>won&rsquo;t
he?&nbsp; Oh, ma, do you think he&rsquo;ll bring Miss
Carin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure he will,&rdquo; said Mary McBirney.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t let him come up here without her if she
had her way, after all the liking she took to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to Jim, ma.&nbsp; She liked Jim just as much as she
did me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go along,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;she wouldn&rsquo;t
&rsquo;a&rsquo; looked at me if you hadn&rsquo;t been there,
Zalie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would too!&nbsp; What makes him act like that,
ma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s naturally modest and retiring,&rdquo; said
pa with a twinkle in his eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;He takes after
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be awful good folks, them Carsons,&rdquo;
said ma admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got plenty of goodness, but they
ain&rsquo;t blessed with any too much sense,&rdquo; remarked
pa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that, Thomas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the folks was telling me how this Mr. Carson goes
riding all over the mountain alone.&nbsp; He don&rsquo;t seem to
have no idea that he might stumble on something it would be best
for him not to see.&nbsp; Any morning, if he gets up early, he <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>can see a
dozen streams of smoke rising from the mountain side, and if
he&rsquo;s got the sense of a mule, he&rsquo;ll know that
there&rsquo;s a moonshine still at every one of them colyumns of
smoke.&nbsp; Any baby&rsquo;d know that.&nbsp; The sensible thing
for folks to do in this part of the country, is to keep to the
beaten track, and not to go too far on that.&nbsp; Them
moonshiners is dreadful sensitive.&nbsp; They think folks is
prying into their affairs when they ain&rsquo;t no such intention
and once they get that idea they make it mighty uncomfortable for
whoever has come under suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to warn him, pa: He can&rsquo;t know our
ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t my ways, I tell you that!&nbsp;
Moon-shining ways ain&rsquo;t my ways,&rdquo; declared pa.</p>
<p>Azalea didn&rsquo;t entirely understand about these
&ldquo;moonshiners&rdquo; as they were called, though she had
heard about them all her life.&nbsp; Pa explained to her that
they were people who made crude whiskey from the corn and sold it
without paying the government the tax which it had placed upon
liquor, and that because they did not pay this tax they had to
make their whiskey in secret.&nbsp; The officers of the
government were always on the outlook for them, and so these
people had <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>to keep on an outlook for the officers, and they were
liable to think that everyone who got anywhere near them was
spying on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the face of it,&rdquo; said pa meditatively,
&ldquo;I suppose it don&rsquo;t seem so bad&mdash;making
something you know how to make and selling it to them as wants to
buy, without saying by-your-leave to no one.&nbsp; But the
country can&rsquo;t be run without money, and one of the ways it
takes to raise money is by placing a big tax on liquor.&nbsp; As
for me, I wouldn&rsquo;t care if &rsquo;twas ten times bigger
than it is.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s done a heap more harm than good, to
my mind, although I&rsquo;m not so pigheaded as to deny that it
can do good sometimes.&nbsp; But it ain&rsquo;t just the making
and selling of the whiskey in secret that hurts these
moonshiners.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the setting themselves against the
law, and getting to be outlaws, and keeping hate and fear and
suspicion in their hearts early and late, and bringing up their
children to the same ideas.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a wicked thing,
Azalea, and it brings trouble beyond measuring to the folks down
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said ma, &ldquo;I know some moonshiners
who are very pleasant people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; cried pa.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll do
anything for their friends and they&rsquo;ll stand by each other
<a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>through
thick and thin.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;re not to think that
they&rsquo;re all ignorant and unlearned.&nbsp; Some of them is
smart as whips, and send their children away to school and take
books out of the public library there at Lee.&nbsp; I could
mention some not an hour&rsquo;s ride from this very spot who do
it.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve known whole communities of moonshiners
to be converted and join the church and turn from their evil
ways, and they make pretty noisy church members, most of
them.&nbsp; It seems like they take their religion hard.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve heard them at camp meeting and they was doing more
hollering and shouting than all the rest put together.&nbsp; I
reckon they thought the Lord had a good deal to
forgive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, pa!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. McBirney.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How you talk!&nbsp; And before the children!&nbsp; But now
you can see, Azalea, why I don&rsquo;t want you wandering around
alone on these mountains.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re likely to run into
one of them stills while they&rsquo;re in operation, and while
they wouldn&rsquo;t do any harm to a girl, they&rsquo;d think it
up to them to give her a dreadful scare.&nbsp; So you stick to
the places you know about.&nbsp; You hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea thought about the moonshiners a good <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>deal after
this.&nbsp; It seemed to her to be dreadful not to be able to
live in a free and open way.&nbsp; She could think of nothing
that she would hate worse than having to hide, or to be forever
on the watch.&nbsp; In the old days when she had traveled with
the show she often had been made to feel that people did not want
them around.&nbsp; They had, in a way, been under suspicion, and
houses were always locked up more carefully when the show people
came to town.&nbsp; Not that there was any need of it, so far as
she knew.&nbsp; They had not been thieves; but they had been
careless and dirty and miserable enough.&nbsp; It was very
different from the life she was leading now.&nbsp; Pa and Ma
McBirney could look anybody in the face.&nbsp; They would go out
from their door, smiling, to meet the people driving by, and
would always beg them to stop and have some spring water or fresh
milk; and Jim and she were proud to be with them.&nbsp; Everyone
seemed to like the McBirneys.&nbsp; Everyone thought they were
good&mdash;and Azalea knew they were and that it was an honor for
her to bear their name.</p>
<p>At the same time, Azalea realized that she was somehow
different from them.&nbsp; For example, ma had spoken of giving
up trying to be like <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>those ladies she traveled
with.&nbsp; When she found they had so many rules and ways which
she couldn&rsquo;t understand, she made up her mind not to worry
about all of these strange matters, but to be contented with her
own people and their manner of doing things.&nbsp; Now Azalea
felt sure that she, for her part, would not have given up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have learned their way of doing
things,&rdquo; she said to herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have
found out about those things that they knew and I didn&rsquo;t,
&rsquo;deed I would.&nbsp; I just hate to have folks get ahead of
me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m like old Nannie; I want to keep up with
everything on the road.&nbsp; And Jim does too, I reckon.&nbsp; I
hope pa and ma will let us go to school when it opens, though Jim
says it&rsquo;s a dreadful long walk.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t
mind walking.&nbsp; Mercy, if anybody knows how to walk,
I&rsquo;m the person!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the very next Sunday that Azalea found out what the
moonshiners would do even to a person they were not much afraid
of.&nbsp; She had gone to the spring house early, to get the
cream and butter, when she saw some one dashing out of the
bushes.&nbsp; It was a boy, but it took her several moments to
find out that it was some one she knew.&nbsp; When she made out
that it was <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>her old friend Hi Kitchell with that white face and
those frightened eyes, she was amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever ails you, Hi?&rdquo; she called, running
toward him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been bitten by a
rattler have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hi was too out of breath to answer at once, and he dropped
down on the seat by the spring house while Azalea brought him a
glass of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was men!&rdquo; he managed to gasp at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was men, Zalie.&nbsp; They was going to kill me, and I
hadn&rsquo;t done no manner of harm to them.&nbsp; I was walking
up the trail&mdash;for I thought I might as well be here in time
for breakfast, since Mrs. McBirney had asked me to spend the
day&mdash;and I thought I&rsquo;d take some short cuts.&nbsp; So
plunk I went up the mountain, and the first thing I knowed, I had
run plumb into a whole gang of men working like good fellows with
a fire and coils of pipe and kettles, and I don&rsquo;t know what
all.&nbsp; Soon as my eyes lighted on to them I guessed it was a
moonshiners&rsquo; still, and I tried to crawl away without
anybody&rsquo;s seeing me.&nbsp; But, sir, one fellow, he caught
sight of me, and he grabbed his gun and started after me, and two
others grabbed their guns, and I just <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>hiked up the mountain and they after
me.&nbsp; But laws, I couldn&rsquo;t run with them fellows.&nbsp;
Seems as if their legs was about three yards long.&nbsp; They got
me in no time and they stood me up against a tree and backed off
and pointed their guns at me and told me if I didn&rsquo;t
promise I&rsquo;d never, never tell on them, they&rsquo;d put so
many holes into me my mother&rsquo;d think I was a sieve.&nbsp;
Well, I give my word I wouldn&rsquo;t tell where their place was,
nor anything about them, and they let me go, but they said if I
wasn&rsquo;t out of sight in two minutes they&rsquo;d fire
anyway.&nbsp; And they run after me a ways just to give me a
start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned up at Azalea, as if half ashamed of the whole
affair, and she laughed back at him, reassuringly, though her
face was rather white too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve told me, Hi,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve broken your promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hi frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zalie,&rdquo; he said sternly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I
tell you everything?&nbsp; Besides, you don&rsquo;t know where
their place is, and I ain&rsquo;t going to tell, partly because I
don&rsquo;t want to, and partly because I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t see how I ever found the way here at all, I was so
mixed up.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>more, I don&rsquo;t attach no
importance to a promise that&rsquo;s wrung out of a fellow like
that.&nbsp; Of course I promised!&nbsp; I had to.&nbsp; But
that&rsquo;s a very different thing from a promise you give on
your honor.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want you to think I&rsquo;d break
a promise, Zalie&mdash;not a fair and square promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Hi! don&rsquo;t I know you wouldn&rsquo;t?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m only teasing.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t say a word about it
to anyone; but it shows ma was right.&nbsp; She said I must keep
to the road and not go prowling off by myself.&nbsp; How are you
getting on, Hi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, first-rate.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like being shut up
in the mill all day any too well, of course.&nbsp; You see, it
comes hard on a fellow who&rsquo;s been used to being out of
doors early and late.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s little children
there, Zalie&mdash;little, little children.&nbsp; It makes me
feel dreadful to see them.&nbsp; I tell you, I&rsquo;m not
meaning to stay there long.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m looking about all the
time for some kind of an outdoor job.&nbsp; Mr. Carson,
he&rsquo;s got me to pulling weeds out of his brick walk.&nbsp; I
have about half an hour after work and before it gets dark and
that lets me do quite a lot at the Carsons; and then they give me
my supper there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that makes such long hours, Hi,&rdquo; Azalea
protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wear yourself
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&ldquo;No I won&rsquo;t, Zalie.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m made of
cast iron.&nbsp; And then the working out of doors sort of rests
me.&nbsp; It gives me an appetite too.&nbsp; And I tell you what,
I want to please Mr. Carson.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a fine man to work
for.&nbsp; He seems to kind of notice me, and I think maybe I can
get took on there at his place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Carsons are like that.&nbsp; They notice
everybody.&nbsp; They even noticed Jim and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you goose, anybody would notice you!&rdquo; cried
Hi.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that yet?&nbsp; Jim&rsquo;s
a mighty pleasant-looking boy too.&nbsp; Looks as if he knew
which end he was standing on, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at that moment Ma McBirney&rsquo;s voice, with a tone of
impatience in it, came out to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Azalea, child, where in the name of goodness have you
gone?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know we&rsquo;re waiting
breakfast?&nbsp; Hurry up, child, do.&nbsp; Pa has just made up
his mind to take us all to the Singing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Singing?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the Singing?&rdquo;
asked Azalea, as she and Hi ran toward the house with the butter
and the milk in their hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you don&rsquo;t know what a <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>singing
is,&rdquo; said pa.&nbsp; Hi and Azalea shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said pa, &ldquo;nobody is to tell
you, and before long you&rsquo;ll see for yourselves.&nbsp;
Hustle now, we ought to have been on the road by this time.&nbsp;
It slipped my mind this was the date, till the Groggings went by
and reminded me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness,&rdquo; sighed ma, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
our best dresses are fresh ironed, Azalea.&nbsp; Here, everybody
pay strict attention to eating!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got to get off
if we&rsquo;re to take any part in the doings!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
THE SINGING</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Hi as he and Jim washed their faces
and gave an extra fine brushing to their hair, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t
I the lucky one though, going off like this with you-all?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t see how it comes your pa and ma are so good to me and
Zalie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comes natural to them,&rdquo; growled Jim, much
embarrassed by this praise of the persons he loved best.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re even good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; cried Hi, sprinkling some water on
Jim&rsquo;s clean waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you, if you think so much of my ma, what are you
spoiling all her work for?&rdquo; shouted Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
need a little learning, that&rsquo;s what you need!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment the two boys had gripped and were rolling on
the floor together.&nbsp; Mrs. McBirney heard the rumpus and came
running, but her gentle voice could barely make itself heard as
the two boys threshed around on the <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>floor, and it took Thomas
McBirney&rsquo;s strong hand and firm voice to bring them to
their feet again, half laughing and half angry, and red as turkey
cocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A likely way to begin the Sabbath,&rdquo; pa reproved
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brush yourselves off now, and get calmed down
before we start.&nbsp; It will be a pleasant sight, seeing you
two standing up hymn-singing, after the way you&rsquo;ve been
carrying on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, when fifteen minutes later the party started off down
the mountain side, the two boys looked like perfect models.&nbsp;
Hi was allowed to sit on the front seat with pa; Jim, Azalea and
Mrs. McBirney sat behind.&nbsp; Ma wore her one white dress and
her black bonnet with the green ribbon, and Azalea had on her new
white dress with the cat stitching in blue; and her white hat
with its blue ribbons was the very hat of hats for her to
wear.&nbsp; Pa McBirney felt secretly proud of his family, but it
wouldn&rsquo;t have been his way to give them a notion of
that.&nbsp; However, ma, who knew most of the things that pa
thought, could tell that he was well pleased.&nbsp; He showed Hi
all the landmarks&mdash;the little broken branches that looked
like two birds <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>sitting side by side on a gaunt live-oak limb that
reached over their path; the &ldquo;cannon,&rdquo; a huge prone
log which had once fallen across the road, and had been sawed in
such a manner that it looked like a gigantic gun ready to be
fired at them; the &ldquo;haunted house&rdquo; where a family of
white-faced, queer folk lived, who ran in and drew down the
shades when they saw anyone coming; and the &ldquo;spy
glass,&rdquo; a curious opening through miles of woodland,
through which a person could look down the mountain side and away
across the valley, where the cotton and the corn grew in their
rich fields and the silver streams wound in and out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, we that live in a place like this are
likely to forget our blessings,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
McBirney.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every way you turn, it&rsquo;s sightly and
a comfort to the eye.&nbsp; If I had to live where it was all
dirt and noise and folks crowding on top of one another, seems
like I&rsquo;d want to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you, just!&rdquo; murmured ma
sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here we are, off pleasuring, on as pretty a day as
God ever dropped down on his footstool.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>Ma
agreed with him, and began to &ldquo;tune up,&rdquo; as pa put
it, humming under her breath.&nbsp; She had her old song book in
her hand&mdash;the book with the square notes, such as the
mountain people always used at their
&ldquo;singings.&rdquo;&nbsp; She explained to Azalea that the
shape of the notes indicated their names.&nbsp; For example, no
matter what key &ldquo;do&rdquo; might be in, it could be told
for &ldquo;do&rdquo; by its shape.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sol&rdquo; would
have another shape; &ldquo;re&rdquo; yet another.&nbsp; In this
manner no one need be confused by four or even six sharps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a custom with us, Azalea,&rdquo; she
explained, &ldquo;to sing the tune through by note first.&nbsp;
After we&rsquo;ve done that, and everybody has got the tune fixed
in his head, so to speak, we go through and sing the
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to tell Hi about the singing,&rdquo;
said Azalea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems mighty queer to me how you-all don&rsquo;t
know about singings,&rdquo; ma replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
ain&rsquo;t nothing but all the folks getting together and
singing.&nbsp; They do it once a year you know&mdash;come from
all over the countryside.&nbsp; There now, look yonder!&nbsp; See
them wagons coming from all parts?&nbsp; They&rsquo;re all off
for Rutherford Plain where the old Friendly Meeting House <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>is.&nbsp;
That was built before the war, all of great oak beams and boards,
and it don&rsquo;t belong to no one denomination, but folks of
whatever belief meet there and give praise and
worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it nice?&rdquo; sighed Azalea
contentedly.&nbsp; It was very sweet to her to be riding along
there, the daughter of people who were so much thought of as the
McBirneys&mdash;she who had been a wanderer, and often a hungry,
neglected child, in clothes she was ashamed of, and the companion
of people she had been unable to respect.&nbsp; Everyone had a
pleasant word for Ma and Pa McBirney, and almost everyone seemed
to know about her and to ask if she was their new daughter.&nbsp;
They said they were pleased to meet her, and when they knew about
Hi&mdash;and the McBirneys were quick to tell&mdash;they said
they were pleased to meet him too, and that they&rsquo;d like
mighty well to do him a good turn if the chance offered.&nbsp;
There was so much talking of this kind to do, that after all, Hi
did not get his description of the singing, and it was only when
he had reached the grove around Friendly Church that he began to
understand what a happy occasion it really was.</p>
<p>Wagons by the twenties stood about, their <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>horses
unhitched and tied beneath the trees.&nbsp; Men, women and
children were gathered in groups, talking and laughing.&nbsp; The
heavy barred doors of the old church were swung wide, and the ivy
and crimson creeper peeped in at its open windows.&nbsp; The boys
helped pa unhitch and were ready when the deep-toned bell
sounded, to go with the others into the church.</p>
<p>The bare yet homely interior was stained a deep reddish brown
by time, and the wide-swung casements let in the sky of the fair
summer day.&nbsp; Elder Miles stood in the pulpit for a few
minutes, to ask a blessing on the gathering, and then a
hook-nosed, slender, restless old man with a voice like a silver
trumpet got up and called for volunteers for the first
singing.&nbsp; He said he thought it would be better to have the
middle-aged folks at the first table, so to speak, and that the
young folks could wait for second helping.</p>
<p>With that, men and women arose in various parts of the room
and went forward.&nbsp; Their weather-colored, work-worn faces
were lighted with smiles as they went down the aisle, nodding to
acquaintances shyly, and taking their places in the seats which
had been arranged just below <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>the pulpit.&nbsp; There seemed to be
no need to inquire which was soprano, alto, tenor or bass.&nbsp;
They had met together for years, and knew each other&rsquo;s
voices well.&nbsp; There were only two who hesitated as if not
quite sure where to go, and Azalea, seeing them, was surprised to
see that it was Mrs. Carson and a tall handsome man, with a touch
of gray in his hair, whom she took at once to be Carin&rsquo;s
father.&nbsp; The hook-nosed man came forward to inquire politely
as to their voices, and after shaking hands with them, placed
them among the sopranos and the tenors.</p>
<p>Then a fresh-faced young woman seated herself at the organ,
and in a moment the chorus of voices broke on Azalea&rsquo;s
ear.&nbsp; It was not the way she had expected it to
be&mdash;that music.&nbsp; It was sad, although full of worship
and trust.&nbsp; The voices wavered curiously, and seemed to
flutter on the notes something as a flag flutters in the
wind.&nbsp; Perhaps the alto and the bass were a little too
strong for the more musical parts; but at any rate, at first, the
little girl was disappointed.&nbsp; Then, someway, she began to
like it.&nbsp; She felt the tears come stinging to her eyes,
though she could not have told why, and a lump gathered in her
throat.&nbsp; She forgot the men and <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>women and the haggard old meeting
house, forgot the sound of the pines without and the humming of
the bees; and she seemed for a moment&mdash;a wonderful
moment&mdash;to be in mid-air like a bird, and to hear a strange,
sad, holy song coming up to her from men and women who toiled,
and hoped, and loved, and suffered, down on the earth.</p>
<p>Some one offered her a hymn book, and the strange moment
passed, and she was able to follow the hymns.&nbsp; They had
noble words to them, and her heart seemed to grow bigger as she
read them.&nbsp; Such words suited her&mdash;fed something in her
that was hungry and cried for food.&nbsp; She began to understand
why it was that Pa and Ma McBirney were so good.&nbsp; They had
been taught these words from the time that they were
children.&nbsp; They had grown up with these beautiful thoughts
in their hearts.</p>
<p>After a time the young people were called for, and the older
ones took their seats.&nbsp; The young wives went and their
brown-faced husbands, and the fresh-faced, wistful girls, and the
boys with their bright eyes.&nbsp; Azalea loved to look at them,
they seemed so strong and contented.&nbsp; She liked the bright
frocks of the girls, and the way <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>their hair was braided, and though
she tried to think of other things, she fell to picturing a green
lawn frock she would have some day when she made money for
herself, and the figured sash&mdash;green leaves on a white
ground&mdash;she would wear with it.</p>
<p>Just then, the man who was sitting next Azalea arose and went
over by the window, and a moment later some one slipped down into
the place he had left and gave Azalea&rsquo;s hand a
squeeze.&nbsp; Azalea turned her head as quick as a frightened
bird, and there sat Carin Carson, smiling at her as if they were
old friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so glad when I saw you here,&rdquo; she
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a pity they don&rsquo;t
ask the children to sing?&nbsp; I just love to sing, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea shook her head.&nbsp; She had sung many a time for the
people who came to the show, but she had hated the silly songs
she was made to sing, and as she thought of them now she
blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I really can sing,&rdquo; she
whispered back.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could once, but my voice is
spoiled.&nbsp; I sang too loud, and now it&rsquo;s all rough and
horrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; returned her
friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your voice is so pleasant when you speak
that I don&rsquo;t see how it can be horrid when you sing.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m to have a singing teacher come to the house twice a
week, and I wish you&rsquo;d come down some time and have her
hear you.&nbsp; Perhaps you sing a great deal better than you
think you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; whispered Azalea, shaking her
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do everything wrong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin laughed under her breath and gave her friend&rsquo;s
hand another squeeze.&nbsp; She was thinking that Azalea was the
prettiest girl in the place, but she had been taught that it was
not nice to pay people compliments, and so she said nothing of
what was in her mind.&nbsp; But she decided that she would enjoy
Azalea&rsquo;s society for that day, and when the singing
adjourned for the people to eat their lunch, Carin insisted that
the McBirneys and her people should eat together.&nbsp; So, by
dint of urging and introducing, she finally had the pleasure of
seeing her father and mother and Mr. and Mrs. McBirney seated
together beneath the shade of some glorious tulip trees,
spreading their luncheons out on one table cloth.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Carson were people who had <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>traveled in
many foreign places, and had heard and seen much that was most
beautiful and wonderful in the world, but their ways were so
simple and hearty that neither Mary nor Thomas McBirney felt
abashed with them.&nbsp; In fact, the Carsons were ignorant of
many things in the country round about them, and they asked
questions as if they were children.&nbsp; The McBirneys answered
them politely, though they really couldn&rsquo;t help wondering
how it was that such learned people didn&rsquo;t know ginseng
when they saw it, or that they hadn&rsquo;t heard about the
asbestos mines in the neighborhood, or didn&rsquo;t understand
how to trap the rabbits that spoiled the gardens.</p>
<p>Azalea was fascinated with the free ways all these Carsons
had.&nbsp; They seemed to say whatever came into their heads, and
they laughed outright in such a hearty and happy way that those
who heard them had to laugh too.&nbsp; Mr. Carson kept running
through the hymn tunes he had heard, though he did it in a quiet,
charming way, not at all as if he wished to attract attention,
but as if he felt himself among friends who would allow him to
follow his impulses.&nbsp; He was, of course, different from all
of the other <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>men there, yet he had a way of making it seem as if
they did him a favor when they were friendly with him, and Azalea
heard him heartily thanking the hook-nosed man&mdash;Mr. Pickett,
his name was&mdash;for having asked him and Mrs. Carson to
sing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never quite had a chance to sing as much as I wanted
to,&rdquo; he said laughingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I sing when I get up,
and when I&rsquo;m in my bath tub, and when I walk and when I
ride.&nbsp; If my wife would let me I&rsquo;d sing at the table,
particularly when I see my favorite kind of custard pie coming
on&mdash;but though I&rsquo;ve done my best, I&rsquo;ve not had
my sing out yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you live down this way long enough,
sir,&rdquo; answered Mr. Pickett, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll try to
satisfy you yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pickett said there would be quite a long recess before the
singing &ldquo;took up&rdquo; again, so Azalea and Carin wandered
away in the woods together.&nbsp; Azalea couldn&rsquo;t help
feeling just a trifle awkward and shy with this graceful girl,
whose clothes seem to move with a mysterious rustle, and who was
like a flower, giving out faint odors of violet as she
walked.&nbsp; Her laugh was gay, but soft, and every word she
spoke <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>seemed to have another accent than that to which Azalea
was used.&nbsp; Azalea wondered how she could be so well pleased
with a simple girl like herself, and with all these hard-working
folk, and she tried to say something of the kind, but she could
find no fit words.&nbsp; So they talked about the woods, and
about the sort of picnics they liked, and about how afraid they
were&mdash;or weren&rsquo;t&mdash;of thunder storms.</p>
<p>As they went on, they came to a beautiful hollow in the
woods.&nbsp; There was soft, very green grass in the bottom of
this cup-shaped place, and ferns and delicate vines grew on the
sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lovely, lovely place!&rdquo; cried Carin,
clasping her hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fit for the fairy queen,
isn&rsquo;t it, Azalea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe in fairies?&rdquo; asked Azalea almost
indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe in them?&rdquo; repeated Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
believe in whatever I want to believe in.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
think it&rsquo;s fun to believe in fairies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of believing in a thing that
isn&rsquo;t true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Carin, sighing, as if she found
it rather hard to bridge the distance between Azalea&rsquo;s mind
and her own, &ldquo;some <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>thoughts are for use and some are
for fun.&nbsp; My shoes are for use, but my gold beads are for
fun.&nbsp; Ideas are like that too.&nbsp; I know the earth turns
over and makes day and night; I play there are fairies just to
suit myself.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like trimming on a
dress&mdash;thoughts of that kind.&nbsp; You like trimming on a
dress, don&rsquo;t you, Azalea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Azalea&rsquo;s answer was a low cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move, Carin!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t move!&nbsp;
Oh, Carin, the snake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin looked and saw.&nbsp; Before her, coiled and ready for
its wicked spring, was a snake with a gleaming, splendid skin,
green and brown and iridescent tints, in diamond shaped pattern,
and on the summer air was a dry, curious rattle that told both
the girls its alarming story.&nbsp; Carin said nothing for the
second or two in which she realized her danger, and she seemed
only to half hear Azalea&rsquo;s sharp cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, jump to one side, Oh, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she had no time to obey, for at that instant, a shot rang
on the air, and the wicked head of the serpent drooped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Oh!&rdquo; screamed Azalea, more terrified now that
the danger was over than she had been before.&nbsp; And
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; sighed Carin softly, and <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>slid down
to the ground and sat there, very white, with one hand to her
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, honey bird, all right,&rdquo;
cried a voice near them.&nbsp; &ldquo;That there sarpent
can&rsquo;t do you no manner of harm now.&nbsp; You jest sit
still a minute or two and get over your scare, and then
I&rsquo;ll escort you back to your folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin and Azalea both turned and looked into the eyes of a
wonderful old man&mdash;looked into eyes, large, dark, and soft,
half hidden beneath bushy eyebrows, and set beneath a beetling
brow.&nbsp; His hair was iron-gray, curling and thick, and it
stood up on his head in such a way as to make him look two or
three inches taller than he really was, and that was quite
unnecessary, for he stood, as he was quick to declare, six feet
and four inches in his stocking feet.&nbsp; He was very thin, and
when he walked he seemed on the point of falling to pieces,
because he had what is known as double joints, so that his arms
and legs swung about in almost any way he wished to have them,
and his head turned about with wonderful ease on his long
neck.</p>
<p>He stooped now and it was an amazing thing to see him do
it&mdash;and picked up a fiddle which he had laid against the
trunk of a tree.</p>
<p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>&ldquo;It certainly was a mighty convenient thing,
having that gun along,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old brother
sarpent, he never would have waited for me to get after him with
a stick.&nbsp; A bullet was the only thing that could put him out
of business, and I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t sure I could hit him at
that distance&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t have, I reckon, if the case
hadn&rsquo;t been so pressing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin got up and ran toward him with her hands
outstretched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&nbsp; Thank you, sir!&rdquo; she said, in
that pretty eager way of hers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know what
you&rsquo;ve done for me, and I must take you to see my papa and
mamma.&nbsp; Why, it was wonderful!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never forget
it as long as I live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady on, steady on,&rdquo; said the man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Knocking the head off a tarnation rascal like that is no
new business with me.&nbsp; Glad, though, to have served you,
little miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed low, and the girls watched him, fascinated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear you playing this morning,
sir,&rdquo; went on Carin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you in at
the Singing?&nbsp; I should think they&rsquo;d love to have you
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My innings are coming, Miss Honey Bird,&rdquo; <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>replied the
man smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t been a singing at
Friendly Church for thirty years that hain&rsquo;t had old
Haystack Thompson there, a fiddling.&nbsp; But I was late getting
here to-day.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been farming it away up on Rabbit
Nose Mountain, and I had to hoof it down here.&nbsp; I started
early enough, but I got lazy like and laid down and dozed
off.&nbsp; When I woke, the sun was high overhead and I just
piked along, but even then I found myself late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will play, though, won&rsquo;t you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I will, Miss Honey Bird.&nbsp; And I pray the
Lord will keep a guard over my bow and hold it down to hymn
tunes.&nbsp; If so be, that thar bow should get Old Nick in it,
as I&rsquo;ve known it to do afore now, I might have the whole
kit and boodle footing the Highland fling or the Virginia reel
right there on the floor of the meeting house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin laughed merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do come along quick and meet papa,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be such good
friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; She ran ahead in her eagerness, urging
&ldquo;Haystack Thompson&rdquo; to follow.</p>
<p>It had not been necessary for her to ask why he had this
curious name, for she knew very <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>well that it had been given to him
because of his wild crop of hair, which did indeed look like a
stack of hay after a bad windstorm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d no idea that Azalea and I had come so
far,&rdquo; she said to her new friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;We wandered
on and on, talking, and when we came to that lovely hollow we
couldn&rsquo;t keep out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were getting to the clearing, and they could see the
people moving toward the church.&nbsp; Mr. Thompson caught a
glimpse of Mr. Pickett, and the two musicians greeted each other
like long-lost brothers, and walked toward the meeting house in
great enthusiasm, making an odd pair, for Mr. Pickett, for all of
his air of importance, reached no higher than Mr.
Thompson&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; Carin found her father just as
he was going in the door and dragged him back to meet her new
acquaintance; and a moment later, everyone had seen &ldquo;Old
Haystack&rdquo; and was clamoring for his music.&nbsp; Mr.
Thompson was given the post of honor, and there he stood,
towering up toward the pointed roof, his faded fiddle in his
hand, tears in his eyes, smiling at his old friends.</p>
<p>He tuned up carefully, and ran his bow lovingly across the
string a few times, then gave a <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>shake to the &ldquo;haystack&rdquo;
and began to play &ldquo;Old Hundred.&rdquo;&nbsp; At first it
was as if a deep voice, full of love of God and life were
singing; then as if a chorus of children&rsquo;s voices sang it
in joy; then as if the wind called it to the sea and the sea
answered; then as if the hills shouted it and the voices of all
living things joined in.</p>
<p>Carin found herself on her feet&mdash;found herself, indeed,
wishing that she could fly.&nbsp; For a moment it seemed as if
she were flying, but when she looked about her, she saw that she
was not, but was standing singing at the top of her lungs with
all the others.&nbsp; And then for an hour, while the tall, gaunt
fiddler drew his music from his instrument, and the people
followed him as if they had one voice, Carin forgot everything in
the world except the music.&nbsp; But suddenly it ended.&nbsp;
The fiddler played some minor theme which no one knew, and which
was born in his brain that moment.&nbsp; All the people took it
for the note of parting and filed out of the church.&nbsp; And
once out, they seemed in little mood to talk.&nbsp; They had been
too deeply moved for that.&nbsp; They preferred to get in their
vehicles and drive off into the silence of the lonely mountain
roads.&nbsp; Carin, certainly, was glad that she could snuggle <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>in the back
seat of their surrey with her mother, and sit there in
quiet.&nbsp; She was strangely tired, and wanted nothing in the
world except to rest, and she thought, in the back of her mind,
that probably Azalea was feeling the same way.&nbsp; That made
her wonder how it was that she had not seen Azalea after they all
went back into the church, and she was just going to speak to her
mother about it, when Mrs. McBirney came running toward them with
a white face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t find Azalea anywhere,&rdquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve looked everywhere&mdash;pa and
Jim and Hi, and Mr. Pickett and lots of others.&nbsp; We
can&rsquo;t find her anywhere!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
THE KIDNAPPING</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she can&rsquo;t be far away,&rdquo; cried Carin,
trembling in spite of herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can
find her, Mrs. McBirney.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s Mr. Thompson?&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll go with me back to the place where we were
together.&nbsp; She came after us for a way, I know.&nbsp; I
thought she followed the whole way, but the singing was just
beginning, and I ran in the church, not noticing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll find her, Mrs. McBirney,&rdquo;
Mr. Carson declared stoutly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The child
couldn&rsquo;t get lost in a clearing like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she lit out,&rdquo; drawled a mountain woman
who was standing near.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell what a
girl brought up to lead a wandering life might do.&nbsp; Tramps
like that ain&rsquo;t to be depended on to keep to roof and
hearth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary McBirney turned toward the woman with flashing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Azalea wouldn&rsquo;t do anything to make me
trouble, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
got a <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>heart of gold.&nbsp; Something has
happened&mdash;that&rsquo;s the whole of it&mdash;something has
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin had sped in search of Mr. Thompson, and having found
him, the two set off in the woods in search of the dell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Haystack&rsquo;s&rdquo; hair seemed to tower higher than
ever, and his green felt cover was half off his violin, and
dangled among the bushes as the two hastened through the
wood.&nbsp; In Carin&rsquo;s heart was the terrible thought of
the rattlesnake.&nbsp; What if the mate to the one Mr. Thompson
had killed had stung Azalea!&nbsp; But why, then, had she not
cried out?&nbsp; It was past imagining.&nbsp; Mr. Thompson took
Carin&rsquo;s hand in his that they might go faster, and the two
hastened on through the sun-flecked wood till they came to the
beautiful hollow with the soft green grass.&nbsp; But they could
see nothing of Azalea, and their calls and halloos brought no
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must try another tack,&rdquo; said Mr.
Thompson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Something queer about this&mdash;something
mighty queer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So all the neighbors seemed to think.&nbsp; The news that
Azalea was missing had spread rapidly.&nbsp; It had overtaken the
departing <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>wagon-loads of neighbors, who returned to lend their
assistance to their distressed neighbors.&nbsp; Parties ran out
in all directions, scouring the woods, calling, peeping into the
old well, and visiting the near-by houses.&nbsp; No one had seen
or heard anything of the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d go into hiding,
sister McBirney,&rdquo; inquired good old Elder Mills, with
sympathy in his eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t seem like that
sort of a girl, but she might have taken offense at something
when no offense was meant.&nbsp; Young folks are like that,
sometimes.&nbsp; I ran away from a good home twice when I was a
boy, because my feelings were so precious tender.&nbsp; Great
fools young folks are!&nbsp; And the worst of it is, they
don&rsquo;t all grow out of their folly when they get
older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McBirney stood there among her neighbors and cast her eye
first on this group and then on that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say it clear and plain,&rdquo; she said in her
pleasant voice; &ldquo;I trust that girl like I would my own son
here.&nbsp; She loves me and I love her, and we&rsquo;re heart to
heart.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s in some kind of trouble, and I reckon I
know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded twenty voices.</p>
<p><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>&ldquo;Them show people has stole her.&nbsp; They said
they would, and they waited till we was off the watch, and took
their chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, ma,&rdquo; said Thomas McBirney,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ve been gone weeks and weeks.&nbsp; They had
about all they wanted of this community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have come back then,&rdquo; answered Mrs.
McBirney with gentle obstinacy, &ldquo;for they&rsquo;ve gone and
took my girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words faltered in her throat, and Jimmy, who was watching
her, ran to her and slipped his arms about her.&nbsp; It was the
first time that his mother had realized that he was not a little
boy.&nbsp; She found in that moment of sorrow that by bowing her
head, she could weep on his sturdy young shoulder, and that he
seemed strong to comfort her.</p>
<p>Hi Kitchell drew near, his eyes shining in a face that was
white beneath all his tan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zalie didn&rsquo;t run away,&rdquo; he said in his
rather gruff voice, which was changing from a boy&rsquo;s to a
man&rsquo;s, and was now in his throat and now in his head.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make me think Zalie ran away.&nbsp; She
wouldn&rsquo;t do such a mean thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she wouldn&rsquo;t, Hi,&rdquo; broke in
the soft tones of Mrs. Carson.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was too kind and
<a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>too
happy.&nbsp; I think we&rsquo;d better drive home, each going our
proper way, watching out on every side for her, and get the
sheriff to send word to all the towns round about.&nbsp; If the
show people have taken her, it ought to be an easy matter to find
her, for the show is bound to go to the towns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; broke in her husband.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do something!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t stand this
waiting around, not knowing what may be happening to the poor
child.&nbsp; Mr. Pickett tells me he&rsquo;ll have every inch of
woods for a radius of two miles around, searched by some of these
young men.&nbsp; So we may leave that quite in his hands.&nbsp;
But he thinks, and I think, that the child has been carried
away.&nbsp; He said he heard the show people kept making their
threats.&nbsp; They heard of the Singing, and judged that Azalea
would be here and that it was their chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have cared for her better,&rdquo; moaned Ma
McBirney.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thomas, I blame myself for not looking
after her better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mary, you&rsquo;ll have to do all the blaming
yourself then, for nobody else will do it.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve set
ourselves to war against the children <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>of Satan, and they&rsquo;ve been
more wily than we took them to be.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all there
is to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light rain had begun to fall and the glory of the day was
quite gone as the people turned from the grove around Friendly
Church and moved off along the six roads that debouched from that
gathering place.</p>
<p>Carin looked sadly from the little window in the curtains of
their surrey, and wondered what strange thing could be happening
to her friend.&nbsp; Though several hours had passed since she
was lost, and though at least two hundred persons had joined in
the search for her, and she had not been found, still, Carin
found it impossible to realize that anything could have happened
to the laughing girl who had run with her through the woods to
the green dell.</p>
<p>Usually Carin liked to ride in the rain.&nbsp; It was fun to
cuddle down beneath the robes, in the dusk of the curtained
carriage, and &ldquo;play.&rdquo;&nbsp; Carin knew how to play
much more delightful things without toys than with them.&nbsp;
She had only to begin pretending that she was a princess who was
being stolen and carried into the desert; or that she was a
missionary traveling over the Himalayas; or a pirate&rsquo;s
daughter, going to hide <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>treasure; or any other of a hundred
things, to have a beautiful time.&nbsp; One of her favorite
&ldquo;pretends&rdquo; had been that about the stolen
princess.&nbsp; But the story had come true in a way, and Carin
found it was not nearly so amusing as she had thought it would
be.</p>
<p>The rain grew heavier and the sky sulkier, and when they
reached home, it was chilly and almost dark.&nbsp; To be sure the
great house was lighted up, and a fire was burning in the living
room, and a delicious supper was spread.&nbsp; But these things
did not bring as much comfort as usual.&nbsp; Mrs. Carson had
insisted that the McBirneys should not climb the mountain that
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll only have to come down in the
morning,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Spend the night with
us.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll telephone the sheriff and get him up here;
and we&rsquo;ll telegraph all the surrounding towns, and
you&rsquo;ll be right here to help and advise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s the stock,&rdquo; objected Thomas
McBirney.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave the poor dumb beasts
hungering and thirsting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi and me&rsquo;ll look after them, pa,&rdquo; said
Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;You just let us take the horses, and
we&rsquo;ll ride up there and &rsquo;tend to things.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed we will,&rdquo; agreed Hi.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The only trouble is, I ought to be at the mill in the
morning.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll be looking for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hi spoke as if the mill would shut down if he didn&rsquo;t get
there on time, and Mr. Carson couldn&rsquo;t conceal a
smile.&nbsp; He liked Hi&rsquo;s important businesslike ways and
his fashion of taking responsibility.&nbsp; So he answered
gravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me to call up the manager of the mill the first
thing in the morning, Hi, and apprise him of the situation.&nbsp;
I may be able to get him at breakfast, so that he&rsquo;ll know
just what to expect before he reaches the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed a reasonable arrangement to Hi, and he hadn&rsquo;t
the faintest notion of the smiles of his elders.&nbsp; So,
mounted on the bare backs of the McBirney horses, the boys set
out to ride up the mountain in the rain.&nbsp; Each wore an old
raincoat which Mr. Carson had fished up from somewhere about the
house, and each carried a lantern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looks mighty lonely to me for them boys to
start off up that mountain alone,&rdquo; sighed Pa
McBirney.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t endure it to think of
the stock going unfed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose those dreadful people <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>will get
after Hi, too, do you?&rdquo; Carin whispered to her
mother.&nbsp; Mrs. Carson started and looked troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare Carin, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
all at sea.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve read of things like this, but
nothing of the sort ever came into my life before, and I
can&rsquo;t more than half believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the way I feel, mamma.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a ring at the doorbell.&nbsp; Perhaps it&rsquo;s
the sheriff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the sheriff, Mr. James Coulter, a heavy man with small
eyes and a square jaw, and with him was Haystack Thompson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to excuse me for coming along,&rdquo;
Haystack apologized.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m in this hunt to
stay.&nbsp; Life&rsquo;s been lagging along pretty slow with me
lately and now here something comes that looks to me like a
man&rsquo;s work, and I&rsquo;ll be plumbasted, if I don&rsquo;t
want a hand in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas McBirney held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always was one for adventures, Mr. Thompson,&rdquo;
he said, with emotion in his voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
grateful for your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they sat together, planning and scheming, till Carin fell
asleep on the sofa, and the oil burned out of the lamps.&nbsp;
The rain fell heavier and heavier and blew in gusts against the
pane.&nbsp; <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>And when Carin staggered up to bed with the help of
Mammy Thula, it seemed to her as if all the pleasant things had
stopped happening and only trouble was at hand.</p>
<p>Very much the same sort of an idea was lying in the bottom of
Ma McBirney&rsquo;s mind, though she tried to answer cheerfully
when her Thomas spoke to her, and she said her prayers as if she
had perfect faith that they were to be answered.&nbsp; But the
truth was, she was too worried just then to have much
faith.&nbsp; She imagined the frightful things that might be
happening to her poor Azalea, and she realized more than ever how
dear the child had become to her, and how she loved her merry
ways and her odd turns of mind, and her way of acting as if the
world was hers.&nbsp; But, more than that&mdash;Oh, much more
than that just at that particular moment, was her anxiety for her
own James Stuart.&nbsp; What was her boy doing just then, she
wondered.&nbsp; The rain was simply threshing against the pane,
and she knew in what torrents it would pour down the mountain
side, ripping new gulleys for itself and deepening the old
ones.&nbsp; It was black as only night and cloud can make the
world, and the horses would be wearied and fretted.</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>&ldquo;I doubt we were right in letting those poor boys
go up the mountain to-night, Thomas,&rdquo; she said, just as the
good Pa McBirney was sinking into slumber.&nbsp; &ldquo;We might
better have let the creatures go hungry for a while than to risk
the lives of those boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to sleep, Mary,&rdquo; commanded Mr. McBirney in a
sleepy voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to have my
night&rsquo;s rest.&rdquo;&nbsp; And indeed, he seemed to be
beginning it before he had finished his sentence, for the next
moment above all the clamor and uproar of the gale, ma could hear
his steady and wholesome snore.</p>
<p>But she lay awake, turning this way and that, creeping out of
bed to look from the window, where nothing could be seen but this
latter deluge, and then huddling in again, praying for the three
wandering children.</p>
<p>And as a matter of fact, prayers could not come amiss for any
of them that night.&nbsp; And really, her own freckled Jim needed
them rather more than the two she had taken under her motherly
wing.&nbsp; For James Stuart McBirney encountered that night one
of the greatest dangers of his short but interesting
career.&nbsp; The two drenched boys had urged their horses up the
<a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>slippery
mountain road, and the horses had plunged on, half blinded by the
storm.&nbsp; The way had been difficult, but all had gone well
enough till they came to the falls where Jim had, several weeks
before, shown Hi his mill and dam.&nbsp; The fall was roaring
down the mountain side, and the boys had no choice but to cross
the swollen torrent as it foamed and writhed across the
roadway.&nbsp; In fair weather this was a safe enough crossing,
and Jim loved it beyond any words of his to say.&nbsp; He would
pause here while his horse drank, and he himself would sit
staring at the dream-like valley, thinking vague and happy
thoughts.&nbsp; But to-night, as he was to learn, the great
boulders that had been placed at the outer edge of the road had
been carried away, and the black water was an enemy&mdash;the
water which had so often been his playmate.&nbsp; Midstream, he
felt his horse slipping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac!&rdquo; he called sharply, slapping the animal
encouragingly, &ldquo;Mac!&nbsp; Pull up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mac, it seemed, could not pull up, though he tried
desperately.&nbsp; His feet went out from under him, and he lay
on his side, with the waters raging about him and bearing him <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>toward that
desperate edge.&nbsp; Once over that, they would drop sheer one
hundred and fifty feet upon jagged rocks where the waters twisted
and hissed like angry serpents.&nbsp; Fortunately, Mac had not
gone down quickly, but after a struggle, and Jim had had time to
free himself from the stirrups.&nbsp; He stood there in the flood
now, with the frantic horse between him and that deadly
fall.&nbsp; The bridle reins were still in his hands, and he held
to them with the instinct of the born horseman, though what a
slender boy could do with a frightened horse in a raging torrent,
it is not easy to imagine.&nbsp; Jim felt both of them going, and
said to himself: &ldquo;One second more and I&rsquo;ll let old
Mac go and get out of this&mdash;if I can!&rdquo; when suddenly
the great body of the horse caught and held.&nbsp; Jim felt that
the animal was bracing himself against something strong and firm,
and he let go the reins to escape the plunging hoofs.&nbsp; But
the next moment, freed from the horse&rsquo;s sustaining back, he
found himself swept from his feet and caught in the terrible
swirl of the waters.&nbsp; Then, for the first time, he screamed
&ldquo;Hi!&nbsp; Hi!&rdquo; though he knew there was small chance
that Hi could hear him.&nbsp; And at that instant, a terrible
thought <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>flashed over his mind.&nbsp; What if Hi had not been
able to cross the ford!&nbsp; What if he, too, had gone down!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!&nbsp; Hi!&rdquo; shouted Jim in his throat.&nbsp; A
thousand wicked voices of the storm answered him; the cruel hands
of the flood clutched him.&nbsp; He swept on, closed his eyes,
and in his terrified, dry little mind thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s about all of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, somehow, miraculously, he too was caught and
held.&nbsp; True, the waters were pounding him, he was smothering
with the spray, but at least he was not being tossed over the
brink.&nbsp; He thrust out desperate hands and clutched the
obstruction.&nbsp; It was a tree in full leaf, which had been
swept from the upper fall and had somehow snarled there on the
rocks.&nbsp; It was what had saved Mac, and at the end of a
frightened, determined struggle, Jim, standing ankle deep, in the
red mud of the road, knew that it had saved him too.&nbsp; And
there, at his hand, trembling, but safe, was good old Mac.</p>
<p>It seemed strange to Jim that his throat could be so dry when
his very skin was soaking and the heavens were emptying torrents
all about <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>him, but it was all he could do to shriek out:
&ldquo;Hi!&nbsp; Oh, Hi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No voice answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; sobbed
Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone over the fall!&nbsp; Oh, what
shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just then above the road came a sharp voice in his
ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up there, ninny!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m here all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&nbsp; Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you&rsquo;ll step on me if you don&rsquo;t watch
out.&nbsp; I guess my arm&rsquo;s broke, Jim.&nbsp; Nannie went
down at the ford, but she got out and ran away from me.&nbsp;
Piked for home, I guess.&nbsp; I hit something, and crawled out,
and then I sort o&rsquo; went to sleep.&nbsp; One arm&rsquo;s
acting funny&mdash;it won&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Hi,&rdquo; cried Jim, &ldquo;never mind if your arm
is broke; that can be mended.&nbsp; But if you&rsquo;d gone
over&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No glue would mend me then,&rdquo; answered Hi.&nbsp;
He struggled to his feet, and the two boys went on in the
darkness.&nbsp; They left Mac to plunge up the road as best
suited him.&nbsp; Both had cast away their lanterns after the
rain and wind had put out the light, and they tramped on in the
blur of mist which told them that they <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>were in the
very heart of a cloud.&nbsp; Sometimes Hi could not keep back a
groan, though he tried manfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just brace up, Hi, you hear?&rdquo; said Jim with
affectionate roughness.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in luck to only
break one bone.&nbsp; My goodness, what&rsquo;s one bone when
you&rsquo;ve hundreds of &rsquo;em in your body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hi set his strong white teeth together and trudged on.&nbsp;
The way seemed like an endless bad dream.&nbsp; But finally he
heard Jim say: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they
were.&nbsp; They were in the good dry cabin, and Hi had sunk on
the settle while Jim lighted the lamps and lit the fire.&nbsp;
That done, he went out to the horse shed and came back with the
cheering news that both horses were in their stalls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see what we
can do about your arm.&nbsp; I know there&rsquo;s arnica in the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arnica!&rdquo; cried Hi in anguished contempt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you think rubbing will do <i>that</i> any
good?&rdquo;&nbsp; He dangled the limp lower arm before
Jim&rsquo;s horrified gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said a gruff voice, &ldquo;rubbing
won&rsquo;t <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>help it none, but setting will, and I&rsquo;m the man
to do it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys turned as quick as owls, and there, standing in the
doorway was a tall, dripping man in homespun mountain
clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Buck Bab!&rdquo; cried Jim, &ldquo;Where did you
come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hi&rsquo;s eyes started from his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you the man that chased me with a gun the
other night?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Bab wrung the rain out of his hair and grinned at Hi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I am,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and maybe I
ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But one thing&rsquo;s certain: I&rsquo;m going
to set that there arm of yours, son.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Jim he
said, &ldquo;You go find me a shingle.&nbsp; Rip one off the
house if you can&rsquo;t do any other way, and I&rsquo;ll take
the liberty of tearing up one of your ma&rsquo;s old
sheets.&rdquo;&nbsp; He bustled about the cabin getting
everything in readiness, and then he came over to Hi, smiling
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t be very bad,&rdquo; he said almost
tenderly.&nbsp; He stooped over him and seemed to tap him gently
on the jaw somewhere below the ear.&nbsp; Jim couldn&rsquo;t make
out what was going on.&nbsp; Suddenly Hi seemed to be asleep, and
he was <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>making no objection at all as Buck Bab&rsquo;s great
hands busied themselves with drawing the broken arm from the coat
and shirt that hampered them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done, Buck Bab!&rdquo; demanded Jim,
thoroughly frightened.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with
Hi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t worry, McBirney,&rdquo; answered Bab
gruffly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I just fixed your friend so he
wouldn&rsquo;t be inconvenienced by what I&rsquo;m about to
do.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s just taking a little nap to order.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll be all right in a minute or two, and by that time
I&rsquo;ll have his arm set as tight as a trap.&nbsp; You
didn&rsquo;t want to hear his hollering and crying, did
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;o,&rdquo; said Jim doubtfully.&nbsp; He drew
nearer to his friend and stood there ready to give any help that
Bab should need.</p>
<p>In ten minutes it was all over.&nbsp; The arm was in place and
held there safely with bandages and splints.&nbsp; Hi&rsquo;s wet
clothes had been dragged from him and he had been wrapped in a
warm blanket.&nbsp; His eyes began to flutter and a sick look to
come into his white face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie still,&rdquo; growled Bab to him, &ldquo;and think
of nothing.&nbsp; And you, McBirney, I suppose you come up here
to look after the stock.&nbsp; Well, get <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>out that
lantern and find the milk pails, and I&rsquo;ll help you.&nbsp;
After we&rsquo;ve fixed up the animals, we&rsquo;ll get some
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought Jim to himself, as he obeyed the
man, &ldquo;who would believe it?&nbsp; I know pa wouldn&rsquo;t,
and I don&rsquo;t believe ma would, though she always says
there&rsquo;s some good in everybody.&nbsp; Buck Bab a
moonshiner, and not denying it!&nbsp; And yet here he is, helping
me out!&nbsp; It seems like a night with a lot of queer dreams in
it.&nbsp; Oh, my!&nbsp; Poor Zalie!&nbsp; Oh, Zalie, where can
you be!&rdquo;</p>

HAYSTACK THOMPSON</h2>
<p>Haystack Thompson lay in bed making uncomplimentary remarks
about the rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just took away the last chanct we had of
following up that poor little mountain lass,&rdquo; said he to
his old clock.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for this
tarnation storm I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; tramped back to that
there dell where I come on them two lasses making eyes at that
rattler, and it would have been mighty funny if I couldn&rsquo;t
have found out something about what happened there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached out for his bag of tobacco, and filling his pipe
and lighting it, tried to bring some cheer into his damp cabin by
smoking very hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have gone over the whole ground,&rdquo; he
mused.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; pretended I was
walking on with that nice little Miss Carin, talking and smiling;
I&rsquo;d thought out how the other lass hung behind, looking at
the trees and flowers, and I&rsquo;d never have give up till I
made out why she <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>didn&rsquo;t reach that church.&nbsp; But here we are,
everything swept smooth as sandpaper with the storm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fell to wishing that for once in his life there was some
one to build the fire for him and get the breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lonesome business,&rdquo; said he aloud,
&ldquo;being pa and ma and all the children just by
yourself.&nbsp; Looks hoggish, now, don&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; I wish
I&rsquo;d divided up and just been the man of the house, and let
some other folks take the rest of the parts.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a
no-count old fool, anyhow.&nbsp; No one but a plumb idiot would
&rsquo;a&rsquo; let that there girl be snatched away like that
yesterday.&nbsp; A blamed, sapless old fool, that&rsquo;s what I
be!&nbsp; Me with nothing but a fiddle to give me an excuse for
living!&nbsp; For my farming would make you sick to look
at.&nbsp; The neighbors snigger when they see it.&nbsp; Well,
what do you think of that now, for a man to reach my age and have
nothing but a fiddle that he cares for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung out of bed in disgust, whipped into his old clothes,
lighted the fire&mdash;which proceeded to smoke badly&mdash;and
got out his bacon and his bag of meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just plumb tired of cooking alone,&rdquo; he
<a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>announced to a squirrel that paused for a moment before
his door, sitting erect on his haunches and casting a wistful
glance from his bright eyes.&nbsp; Haystack tossed him some
ground nuts which he kept in a bag for that purpose, and then
turned angrily to his own meal.&nbsp; Halfway through it, he laid
down his knife and fork, and a light broke over his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go find that little lass.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make
myself of some use, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp; See
here, Betsy,&rdquo; he went on, turning to his violin and
speaking to it as if it were a little sister, &ldquo;you and
me&rsquo;ll start out and find that there poor lass, you
hear?&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been playing stick-in-the-mud about long
enough.&nbsp; What we need is to get a move on us and to go out
and see something of the world.&nbsp; What you say,
Bet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a log fell on the hearth, and from Betsy&rsquo;s
answering strings came forth a delicate wail.&nbsp; Haystack took
it to mean that they should go, and when he had made his cabin
tidy&mdash;and he took much more pains with it than
usual&mdash;he put on clean homespun, packed a change of clothing
in a square of blue denim, fastened this to a stick which he
threw over his <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>shoulder, and taking Betsy under the other arm, started
out on a quest.</p>
<p>At about the same time the sheriff at Lee and Pa McBirney and
Mr. Carson and Elder Mills and Mr. Pickett and a great many other
persons were bestirring themselves to the same end.&nbsp; They
telegraphed here and they telephoned there, and all over the
county the good neighbors were keeping an outlook.&nbsp; Ma
McBirney and Mrs. Carson kept together and talked over this and
that phase of the matter, and both of them poured out their kind
hearts in good wishes, as if their love would build a wall around
the lost child to keep her from harm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let no evil touch her, dear Lord,&rdquo; prayed Mary
McBirney over and over again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy power is
everywhere, and Thy love is all protecting.&nbsp; Spread Thy love
about her like a cloak and keep her from harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was just about the time that Azalea, aroused from her
thin and worried sleep by the first streaks of the dawn that
streamed to her over the level low country, drew the dirty
bedclothes closer about her chin, and tried to make out whether
or not it was all a bad dream.&nbsp; Tige, the bulldog, crouching
there at the tent door, <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>and snarling if she but moved,
certainly seemed like a nightmare.&nbsp; Betty Bowen with her
frowsy head and her horrid red flannel bed-gown, sleeping with
her mouth open on the shake-down next to Azalea, and the
miserable old show wagon outside, with lumbering Rafe Bowen, the
son of Betty, snoring in rivalry to the robins&mdash;not that his
opera in any way resembled theirs&mdash;was something worse than
ordinary nightmare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a dream,&rdquo; sighed Azalea, with
deep, terrible conviction.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went over the sharp little drama of all that had happened
the day before; remembered the sweet hollow in the woods where
she and Carin had gone, the fright they had had at the snake, the
appearance of that queer, kind old Haystack Thompson; she
remembered how she had followed them a little way, and then had
stopped for some wake robins which were growing in a sunny little
spot and which she had thought would look lovely at Ma
McBirneys&rsquo; belt; and then had come the strange whimpering
of an animal in pain.&nbsp; She had thought it a dog caught in a
rabbit trap, and she had gone toward it, and as she went on, the
sound seemed <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>to move too, and it grew more agonizing as if the
animal were being tortured beyond anything it could stand.&nbsp;
And then, suddenly, from among the great trees, had come Sisson,
the &ldquo;showman,&rdquo; her old enemy.&nbsp; He had his huge
hand over her mouth in a minute, and had pushed her before him,
making her run against her will, and presently they were among
all the old companions of her wandering years.&nbsp; Rafe Bowen,
who had run away three years before, was back too.&nbsp; He was a
big fellow with broad shoulders and a sullen face.&nbsp; And
there was a new woman&mdash;to take her mother&rsquo;s place,
Azalea thought.&nbsp; They had laughed at her and told Sisson not
to be too rough with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You treat her like she was a mad steer, Hank,&rdquo;
Betty Bowen had said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scare the young un
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sisson let go of her and pushing her a little way from him
broke into a roar of laughter.&nbsp; It made cold chills run over
the girl.&nbsp; She knew that when Sisson laughed it was when
some one else was in trouble.&nbsp; Nearly the only thing he
really enjoyed was tormenting some one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ran out to meet me,&rdquo; he cried, roaring with
that cruel laughter, his eyes full of evil <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>pleasure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just toddled out to meet me, she
did.&nbsp; You never saw anything like it.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t
stay away from her old friend, Zalie couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Once a
show girl always a show girl, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea had been learning lessons of self-control since she had
been with Mary McBirney, but now her old-time temper flamed up in
her.&nbsp; She felt the familiar wave of fire sweeping across her
brain and she screamed out angry things at Sisson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no show girl!&rdquo; she protested.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never wanted to be a show girl.&nbsp; I think you are
wicked, wicked, Hank Sisson!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve taken me away
from the best people I ever knew and they&rsquo;ll be so
frightened!&nbsp; Oh, please, Mrs. Bowen, make him let me
go.&nbsp; Oh, Hank Sisson I hate you!&nbsp; I hate you!&nbsp; Oh,
why isn&rsquo;t my mamma alive?&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t dare
treat me like this if she was alive.&nbsp; You bad, bad
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see for yourself, what a fine performer she
is,&rdquo; Sisson sneered.&nbsp; &ldquo;High tragedy,
that&rsquo;s her line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Bowen,&rdquo; wailed the girl, &ldquo;mamma
was good to you.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you help me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turning on the tear taps now,&rdquo; grinned
Sisson.</p>
<p><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>&ldquo;Oh, shut up,&rdquo; snapped the new woman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What did you expect the girl to do?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t
think she&rsquo;d rejoice, did you?&nbsp; Leave her be, you
Sisson.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got her, that&rsquo;s the main thing;
now give her a chance to cool down a little.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sorry for the young un, that&rsquo;s what I am&mdash;taking her
away from a good home to tag along with a lot like us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sisson raised his heavy fist and made as if to strike the
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take your choice,&rdquo; he growled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shut up or be shut up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we&rsquo;re rowing around here, Hank,&rdquo;
broke in Betty Bowen, &ldquo;the folks will be after us.&nbsp; Do
we carry out our plan, or don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We carry it out and we do it quick,&rdquo; announced
Sisson.&nbsp; Nor was Azalea long in finding out what the plan
was.&nbsp; Taking it for granted that as soon as Azalea was
missed, the Sisson All Star Combination would be under suspicion,
it was the intention of Sisson and his troupe to go on up into
the mountains; but Betty Bowen and her son Rafe were to take the
best team of horses, and the wagon with its load of conveniences,
hide by night in the woods, and then make their way before dawn
into South <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>Carolina.&nbsp; The state line was not more than twelve
miles from where they then were, and once across that, they were
comparatively safe.</p>
<p>This program had been carried out rapidly&mdash;more rapidly,
in fact, than was at first intended.&nbsp; Azalea was compelled
to go in the old covered wagon and to lie down there under a pile
of odds and ends.&nbsp; Betty sat beside her son Rafe and
directed their course.&nbsp; They had struck an old wood-road,
and wound along through the heart of a silent forest, meeting no
one.&nbsp; So much more solitary was the road than they had
supposed it would be that Betty urged her son to press on.&nbsp;
The horses were young and strong&mdash;a new team which Azalea
had not before seen&mdash;and the result was that by twelve
o&rsquo;clock that night they had camped in an out-of-the-way
grove across the line dividing the two Carolinas.&nbsp; The
mountains were left behind, and an almost level plain stretched
around them.&nbsp; But the underbrush in this grove of poor trees
was thick, and as Betty intended to do her cooking at night and
to show no smoke from her camp fire to curious strangers during
the day, they felt that there was little danger of their being
found.</p>
<p>The rain that had drenched the valley of Lee <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>had thrown
out no more than a light shower over the spot where the Bowens
kept Azalea prisoner, and while the girl lay on her rickety bed
wondering what had happened back at home, she did not dream of
the wild experiences through which her friends Jim and Hi had
been passing.&nbsp; It was not of them that she thought
chiefly&mdash;though she knew how they would be fuming about her
and putting plans on foot for her recovery&mdash;but of Ma
McBirney and her anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so used to having bad times,&rdquo; thought
the little girl wrapping her arms tight about her body as if for
company, &ldquo;that I can stand them.&nbsp; But Ma McBirney
isn&rsquo;t used to them.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll just fret herself
crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had perfect confidence in the ability of her friends to
find her.&nbsp; She had thought all that out in that strange,
dangerous drive at night through the old wood-road.&nbsp; People
like Pa McBirney and Mr. Carson weren&rsquo;t the kind to give up
hunting for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got to lie low,&rdquo; thought this
child who had seen too much of the ways of a prowling company of
folk, &ldquo;and take care of myself the best way I can, and
I&rsquo;ll be found.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>back in Ma
McBirney&rsquo;s house all right and tight in a little
while.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to believe that and say it over and
over.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to be scared, nor sorry, nor
anything.&nbsp; Jim and Hi will think I&rsquo;m a silly thing to
let myself be picked up and carried away like that, anyway.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ll think I haven&rsquo;t a bit of grit.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;ll show them I&rsquo;m not such a stupid goose after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made up her mind, too, that she would try not to think too
much about Ma McBirney.&nbsp; If she did she would get to crying
again, and she didn&rsquo;t want to cry.&nbsp; She wanted to
think, and to watch, and to be wise and act at the right
moment.&nbsp; And having reached that conclusion, she sat up in
bed with something almost like brightness on her face.&nbsp; And
at that Tige, the bulldog, sat up too and showed all of his teeth
as he gave a low growl.&nbsp; Tige was a good dog according to
his lights; and his lights told him that when his master, Rafe
Bowen&mdash;according to Tige, the most wonderful master in the
world&mdash;told him to &ldquo;watch,&rdquo; why then, he was to
watch; nay he was to sleep with one eye open and both ears
alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness sake, Tige,&rdquo; whispered Azalea,
leaning forward and putting out her hand <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>toward the
dog, &ldquo;be sensible, can&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to
move sometimes, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty Bowen threw her brown arms up over her frowsy head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still, you, Zalie,&rdquo; she snarled
sleepily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m dead
beat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So for two hours longer the restless girl had to lie still in
her bed, though it became almost an agony to do so, while the
tired show woman slept on and on.&nbsp; After a time, however,
the little camp came to life.&nbsp; Rafe got up and demanded
breakfast.&nbsp; Betty straggled out, heavy-eyed and slatternly,
and set forth some cold food which Azalea could not
swallow.&nbsp; The horses were fed, the wagon greased, and all
was got in readiness for a hasty flight if necessary.&nbsp;
Azalea helped as they directed her, and she managed to find a
chance to wash carefully as Ma McBirney had taught her, and she
combed her hair with a little side comb, and made herself look as
well as she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got mighty fine ways since you&rsquo;ve
been living out,&rdquo; remarked Betty Bowen teasingly.&nbsp;
Azalea looked at her as candidly as she would have looked at Ma
McBirney, for <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>someway, in spite of all her anger, she was feeling
sorry for Bet Bowen this morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Bowen,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
been taught some nice ways.&nbsp; Mrs. McBirney is the neatest
woman you ever saw.&nbsp; Of course my own mamma tried to teach
me things, but what was the use, when we didn&rsquo;t have any
way to keep nice?&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t keep clean and fresh on
the road, can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty looked at the girl in sullen surprise.&nbsp; She had not
expected to be met in this neighborly fashion.&nbsp; She thought
to herself that if she were being held a prisoner, no one could
get her to &ldquo;chirk up&rdquo; like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you bet you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said in answer
to the girl&rsquo;s question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now me, I used to wash
my hair and brush it, and keep my hands pretty.&nbsp; I
wasn&rsquo;t always a battered old ship of the desert like I be
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bet could be rather picturesque in her speech
when she had a mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fact is, I reckon I had too
much good looks and too little sense once on a time.&nbsp; Both
the sense and the looks have been knocked out of me now.&nbsp; I
guess you or anybody can see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever made you take up with this show life, Mrs.
Bowen?&rdquo; the girl asked.&nbsp; They were <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>sitting
together then on the ground, their little odd tasks being all
done.&nbsp; Azalea was playing idly with some pine needles,
braiding them together after a fashion she had, and weaving them
into a little mat.&nbsp; In the old days she would have sat idle,
but Ma McBirney had got her into the way of occupying herself
with one thing and another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made me take to it?&rdquo; demanded Bet, turning
her haggard eyes on her companion, &ldquo;Why, the same thing
that made your mother take to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something threatening and angry in the way she
spoke, and Azalea looked at her with fear in her eyes.&nbsp; She
could feel her heartbeats fairly strangling her, but she had the
courage to seize at the remark.&nbsp; Ever since she was old
enough to think at all, she had been puzzled and bewildered by
the things about her.&nbsp; And now it seemed she might be told
something of all she wished to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why was that, Betty?&rdquo; she asked softly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why did my mamma have to wander around and act in a
show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bowen drew an old rag of a shawl about her shoulders and
leaned back against a tree.&nbsp; <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>She seemed to be trying to make up
her mind whether to tell this child the truth or not.&nbsp; But
finally she gave a little nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to up and tell you why,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s coming to you to
know.&nbsp; She did it because she married a poor shiftless coot
of a man, the black sheep of a way-up family, and she done it
against the wishes of all her folks.&nbsp; She ran away from home
with him, and she took care of him while he lazed around and
wouldn&rsquo;t do nothing, and she looked after him like he was
the best man in the world, and stuck to him when he gambled away
all she earned.&nbsp; And then you was born, and she had to run
away from him to get money enough to care for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; gasped Azalea, her hand at her heart and a
sick feeling stealing over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will say,&rdquo; went on Bet, &ldquo;that she
cared for you as tender as if you was respectable folks living in
the finest house in town.&nbsp; She just done the best she could;
and she went along with us because we didn&rsquo;t object to
having a baby in the troupe.&nbsp; We began training you like a
little puppy as soon as you had any mimicry in you, and the folks
that came to the show liked it.&nbsp; Her and you was drawing
cards, I can tell you.&nbsp; <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>And for all of her broken heart she
was nice and cheerful except when we&rsquo;d go to the towns near
by where she used to live.&nbsp; Then she was afraid she&rsquo;d
meet some of them that used to know her in the old days.&nbsp;
But at last, when she found she was going to die, she seemed glad
we was edging along toward her home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where was that,&rdquo; breathed rather than asked
Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where was her old home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law, child, don&rsquo;t you know that?&nbsp; Why, her
old home was at Lee.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where your grandfather
Atherton come from&mdash;from Lee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandfather Atherton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Zalie.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t your ma tell you
that?&nbsp; Well, she was a close one.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
as she told us all, either, but we got hold of the story one way
and another.&nbsp; When her father skipped out to parts unknown,
owing to some trouble he got into at the time of the war, his
wife&mdash;she was his second wife, and only a young
thing&mdash;went back to her folks in Alabama for a while.&nbsp;
And then they was made so poor by the war that she took shame to
be dependent on them.&nbsp; So she came back to this part of the
country, somewhere, and taught school, and took care of her
little girl.&nbsp; And that little girl was your ma.&nbsp; <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>She was a
pretty little thing, made to live in luxury, I allow.&nbsp; I
suppose she sort of honed for grand ways and grand clothes.&nbsp;
Anyway, when your pa, Jack Knox, who come of an old family and
was handsome and taking in his ways, came along, she married
him.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t know the drinking and the
shiftlessness had come down to him as well as the fine manners
and the handsome face.&nbsp; I heard your grandmother fought and
fought against them two marrying, but they would have their
way.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s your story, missy, and I do think it
was coming to you to know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea stared into the woman&rsquo;s face with wide-stretched
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Bowen.&nbsp; I am glad
to know; I do think I had a right to be told.&nbsp; But just
think, I was in that old house the other day&mdash;that beautiful
old house that belonged to my grandfather.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
Shoals&rsquo; it is called.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s very, very
queer, but I felt all the time as if I had been in it
before.&nbsp; But of course I never had.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t
inherit memories, can you Mrs. Bowen, the way you do the features
of your face, or&mdash;or habits?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p178.jpg">
<img alt=
"&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s your story, missy.&rdquo;"
title=
"&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s your story, missy.&rdquo;"
 src="images/p178.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>But at that moment, Betty Bowen&rsquo;s great hulk <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>of a son
came sauntering back from what he called a
&ldquo;spying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nobody in sight so far as I can make
out,&rdquo; he announced sullenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now suppose
you two quiet down a little.&nbsp; I want to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He whistled his dog to him and pointed with a big forefinger
at Azalea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch, Tige,&rdquo; he commanded.&nbsp; And he and the
dog stretched themselves side by side, the man to sleep, and the
dog to keep guard.</p>
<p>Azalea felt a wave of trembling creeping over her, and she
turned her eyes once more to Bet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Bowen,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;what have
I done that you should treat me like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Bowen lifted her finger in warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just keep still, Zalie,&rdquo; she answered, also under
her breath, &ldquo;and you won&rsquo;t be hurt.&nbsp;
Sisson&rsquo;s a man that hits back when he&rsquo;s hit.&nbsp; He
was all-fired mad at your being took from him and he swore
he&rsquo;d have you back.&nbsp; He seemed to have to do it to
keep up his pride.&nbsp; So now he&rsquo;s got you, and I&rsquo;m
to keep you, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can you, Betty?&nbsp; How can you?&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t do anything mean to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty Bowen looked at her darkly.</p>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>&ldquo;Sisson is kin of mine,&rdquo; she said, as if
that settled the question.&nbsp; &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nobody
else in the world for me to turn to as I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lump came into Azalea&rsquo;s throat as she looked at
Betty.&nbsp; To think of having no friend but Sisson!&nbsp;
Something warm began to stir in Azalea&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; She
did not know that the name of it was pity.</p>
<h2><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>CHAPTER X<br />
THE ESCAPE</h2>
<p>Mrs. McBirney sat at her loom.&nbsp; Eyes, hands and feet were
busy; but no matter how busy she kept them she could not keep her
mind and heart at ease.&nbsp; She had come back home when she
found that the search for her missing girl would be a long one,
and from early morning till late at night she kept about her
tasks.&nbsp; She had a theory that there was nothing like work to
help a troubled mind to forgetfulness, and she put her theory to
the full test.</p>
<p>Pa McBirney went about his tasks, too, and his face grew
careworn as he saw the old restlessness and torment coming back
in his wife&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the way she carried on after your
sister Mollie passed away,&rdquo; he said to Jim.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d take Azalea&rsquo;s
loss so hard, but then it&rsquo;s kind o&rsquo; emptied her life
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jim in an old way he sometimes <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>had,
&ldquo;if she knew Azalea was dead and safe, perhaps she
wouldn&rsquo;t feel so dreadful bad.&nbsp; But not knowing where
a body is&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I call tormenting.&nbsp; When I
think of the things that might be happening to Azalea&mdash;her
maybe going hungry or being beat with sticks, or goodness knows
what all&mdash;it makes me as nervous as a bat.&nbsp; Hi&rsquo;s
just the same way, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hi&rsquo;s broken arm had made it impossible for him to return
to the mill, and he was spending his time with the
McBirneys.&nbsp; He seemed to be actually greedy to learn all he
could of this pleasant home.&nbsp; He listened to all Ma McBirney
had to say, as if her words were gold; he watched Pa McBirney
about his work; he played chess with Jim and studied Jim&rsquo;s
schoolbooks under Mrs. McBirney&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<p>Mrs. McBirney wrote home to his mother for him, and told her
all that had happened to him.&nbsp; At first Hi objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle Hank Sisson will be after her first chance he
gets, to find out where I am, and if she knows, he&rsquo;ll worm
it out of her,&rdquo; the boy objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s neither here nor there, Hi,&rdquo; Ma
McBirney had insisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just aching to
know <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>what&rsquo;s happening to her boy, and I&rsquo;m going
to let her know.&nbsp; Why, you ought to be with your ma,
Hi.&nbsp; Somehow or other we&rsquo;ve got to get the family down
here.&nbsp; Now, when your arm&rsquo;s well, you can go back to
the mill, and perhaps some of the other children are old enough
to take a hand too; and what with all the tourists that come to
Lee, your ma could sure find work&mdash;washing, or sewing, or
some such thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my, wouldn&rsquo;t that be fun!&rdquo; sighed
Hi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Mary,&rdquo; Pa McBirney had broke in,
&ldquo;what makes you lift up that boy&rsquo;s hopes the way you
do?&nbsp; Like as not they&rsquo;ll all be dashed to
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a-way should they be dashed for, father?&nbsp;
Ain&rsquo;t it right that Hi and his ma should be together?&nbsp;
And don&rsquo;t you believe that what&rsquo;s right will come to
pass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa shook his head doubtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
as that has been according to my experience,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it has, Thomas.&nbsp; You know it has!&nbsp;
And everything&rsquo;s going to come right for Hi&mdash;and for
Azalea, Thomas&mdash;and for you and Jim and me!&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll see!&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t break down my faith,
Thomas.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>And
Thomas McBirney, looking at her face with its look as of a light
burning through it, knew that he must not, indeed.</p>
<p>The second Saturday after Azalea&rsquo;s disappearance, a
letter came to the Lee post office for Pa McBirney from Haystack
Thompson.&nbsp; It read like this.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Deer Nabor:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many wagons did the Sisson All Star Combinashun
have when you saw them last?&nbsp; Adres me with the show.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;C. W. Thompson.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pa McBirney made use of the telegraph for the first time in
his life, being moved to the act by the insistence of Mr.
Carson.&nbsp; He responded briefly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were three wagons.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Wire my
expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the answer came:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because now he&rsquo;s got two only.&nbsp; I am
fiddling for the show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Haystack!&rdquo; cried Mr. Carson when he read
the telegraphic message.&nbsp; And he himself ventured on a
dispatch to Mr. Thompson.</p>
<p><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>&ldquo;Keep on fiddling,&rdquo; he wired.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The third wagon will come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mr. Carson rode home hard with the news to his Carin; and
Mr. McBirney put his tired horses up the long mountain road to
carry the word to his Mary.&nbsp; And Azalea&rsquo;s friends took
heart, and hoped on and prayed on; and the sheriff made his more
or less languid inquiries, and the newspapers printed articles,
and hundreds of people who did not know Azalea at all were very
much interested.</p>
<p>But all this was not greatly helping Azalea through the long
days.&nbsp; They kept out of sight as much as
possible&mdash;Betty Bowen and her odd
&ldquo;family.&rdquo;&nbsp; By creeping along old roads and only
stopping at the most out-of-the-way villages they seemed to
escape the curiosity of the people.&nbsp; Indeed, many of those
they came across seemed not to have energy enough for anything so
lively as curiosity.&nbsp; Azalea always had taken an interest in
the world, and the best part of the old life had been, to her,
the quiet journeys along the roads, with the glimpses they gave
of farmhouses and cabins and little towns.&nbsp; Now that she had
come to know so many warmhearted new people, and that her own
heart was <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>aglow with the remembrance of it all, her interest in
the homes she passed was keener than ever.&nbsp; So long as she
was allowed to sit where she could look out, she did not greatly
mind the days.&nbsp; In spite of the constant watch kept over
her, and of the fact that she had not dreamed it would be so long
before she was restored to her friends, she would not be
downcast, and it was only when Bet gave the word that they were
to halt and go into camp for a day that the girl found life
unendurable.</p>
<p>To be sure she grew very weary of going over and over the same
thoughts; of wondering and wondering why no one came to her aid;
of thinking what would happen to her when they had caught up with
Sisson and his show.&nbsp; But when the dread and the fear were
at their worst, she remembered certain words that Ma McBirney had
spoken to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter what comes to you, Azalea,&rdquo; she had
told her once, &ldquo;you keep your heart full of God&rsquo;s
light and of God&rsquo;s love, and nothing can really harm
you.&nbsp; You mind what I say, child.&nbsp; You do that and the
angels of the Lord will compass you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Betty Bowen had been her enemy she could <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>have broken
the child&rsquo;s heart, or let her become exposed to some of
those vague dangers which Azalea half imagined.&nbsp; But she was
not her enemy.&nbsp; In her tired, discouraged way she seemed to
like her.&nbsp; And she admired her.&nbsp; She used to command
the child to sing and Azalea sang the sweet songs she had learned
from Carin and from Ma McBirney.</p>
<p>They had crept up into the mountains by roundabout ways, and
were now feeling their way toward the Sisson All Star
Combination, the precise location of which they did not
know.&nbsp; When Azalea learned that, in spite of herself, she
began to feel anxious.&nbsp; Little by little the courage in her
heart oozed out, leaving her a sad and trembling child.&nbsp; If
the old-time wanderings with the show had been hateful to her
when she was with her mother, she knew they would be much, much
more so now that she was alone and unfriended.&nbsp; It is
possible for children to feel black despair, and something like
that came to Azalea.&nbsp; It was evident to her that her friends
had failed to get on her track, and in the long, idle, sodden
hours of thought, she decided that her escape depended on
herself.</p>
<p>Little by little the watch set over her had <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>grown less
strict.&nbsp; She had made no attempt to get away, and Betty and
her son had come to count her in as a part of their
company.&nbsp; They could not, indeed, imagine what would become
of her should she leave them.&nbsp; Sour and bitter as their
natures were, they really could not help liking this winsome
girl, whose voice and manner seemed to speak to them day by day
of better things than they had ever known.&nbsp; And liking her,
they no doubt felt that she liked them.&nbsp; At least, as they
traveled together, or made camp in some wild, beautiful mountain
cove, or worked side by side around the camp fire, she gave no
sign that was not friendly.&nbsp; Even Tige had come to watch her
in a spirit of defense rather than of attack.</p>
<p>So one night when they had been sitting late before the camp
fire, and she had gone into the tent to go to bed, she crept
beneath the canvas at the rear and stole away through the
woods.&nbsp; If it had not been for the crackling of the camp
fire, she might have been overheard; and if it had not been for
the growing weakness which kept poor weary Bet drowsing sleepily
there before the blaze, her escape would soon have been
discovered.&nbsp; But as it was, not even the alert <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>Tige had a
hint of her going.&nbsp; He lay snoring and nuzzling before the
fire, dimly aware that his master was near, and asking for no
greater happiness.&nbsp; And that master sat there beside him,
his head in his hands, thinking thoughts that for him were
strange indeed.&nbsp; He had come back from a life of wandering
and self-indulgence to prey upon his mother.&nbsp; She was a
clever one&mdash;so he put it&mdash;and if she wanted him to keep
out of mischief, let her find some way to care for him!&nbsp; But
now, after these weeks in the company of the young girl who
looked out at life with kind and trusting eyes, and who was
polite even to the woman who kept her prisoner, Rafe began to see
things in a different light.&nbsp; He had meant to torment that
girl, and he had thought that he would have pleasure in doing
it.&nbsp; But he had, someway, not been able to carry out his
intention.&nbsp; She had seen through him&mdash;had believed in
his good nature in spite of everything.&nbsp; And he knew now
that he wanted to be the way she thought him.&nbsp; He wanted her
to think of him as something besides a bully and jailer.&nbsp; He
wished his mother were different from what she was; wished from
the bottom of his heart that the two of them were something <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>better than
wandering vagabonds.&nbsp; If they had lived in a proper house,
if his father had not left them, if he could have had a sister
like Azalea, he would have made a very different fellow of
himself from what he was.</p>
<p>He wondered if, after all, it was too late.&nbsp; There were
things he knew how to do.&nbsp; If his mother would give up this
wandering and settle down in some quiet little place and keep
Azalea with her, and if they could have really good things to
eat, and a hearth to sit before rainy nights, and clothes that
were decent and clean, why perhaps, after all, a fellow could
&ldquo;get shet&rdquo; of the drinking of corn whiskey and the
gambling and all.&nbsp; Rafe was young still, and the little kind
angel of his better impulses had not all been slain by his black
selfishness and his coarse appetites.&nbsp; So he sat and dreamed
before the fire, and was somehow washed almost innocent again by
the great sea of goodness that forever stretches about us, and in
which we may, if we will, bathe and purify ourselves.&nbsp; The
night and the stars, the wind and the fire were there to help him
find himself.&nbsp; And while he dreamed, Azalea clipped on
through the thick-growing laurel, skirted a little spring-fed
pond, <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>and finding the wagon-road, fled down the mountain with
feet that felt as light as feathers&mdash;as light as her
heart.&nbsp; All of her courage had come rushing back.&nbsp; She
said to herself that she would never be taken
again&mdash;never.&nbsp; She was not going to have her life
spoiled.&nbsp; It was her life and she meant to &ldquo;run
it&rdquo; to suit herself.&nbsp; And as she fled, it seemed as if
the little brown, thin hands of her dead mother were held out to
help her; and as if the strong, kind hands of Ma McBirney were
stretched in welcome; and the good, freckled hands of Jim and Hi
beat together in encouragement.</p>
<p>Yes, they were patting &ldquo;juba&rdquo; for her, were Jim
and Hi, and to the patter, patter, her feet sped on.&nbsp; She
was not afraid of the night.&nbsp; She liked it.&nbsp; The stars
saw what she was doing and were glad.&nbsp; The night bird that
called out, kept the woods from being too solitary.&nbsp; The
very wind was in her favor, and pushed at her back.&nbsp;
Sometimes she stopped to rest, and she would have liked to
sleep.&nbsp; But it seemed foolish to do that.&nbsp; The point
now, was to get safe away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was caught napping once,&rdquo; she said to herself
with a dry little laugh, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t mean to be
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>Along
toward morning she came on a little village&mdash;one she had not
seen before.&nbsp; There was not a light anywhere, but the houses
clustered together like comfortable sheep in the darkness, and
she felt happier for being among them.&nbsp; Now that she was
safe with these other human creatures, her weariness and
sleepiness almost overcame her.&nbsp; It was growing chilly as
the morning air quickened&mdash;though as yet there was no hint
in the sky of coming light&mdash;and she shivered in her thin
clothes.&nbsp; She still wore the white frock that had been so
dainty and sweet the day of the Singing, but which was now a
dusty rag.&nbsp; Her hat she had left behind her.&nbsp; The hair
Ma McBirney had taught her to brush every night was full of the
dust of the road.&nbsp; All of that pleasant cleanliness which
she recently had been taught, had been of necessity lost in the
life she had been leading.&nbsp; She felt ashamed as she thought
how she would look to strangers, who probably would think her a
miserable vagabond.&nbsp; However, her state could be remedied in
time.&nbsp; Now the thing was to get in out of the cold; for she
was drenched with sweat and her damp clothes clung to her.</p>
<p>She turned into one of the little yards, and <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>going
around to the rear of the house, tried the handle of a shed
door.&nbsp; It yielded, and she stepped into a dark little room
smelling of firewood.&nbsp; At the far side was an open door, and
she groped her way to it and stood on a little framed-in porch
with wire netting on the one exposed side.&nbsp; And there,
neatly made, was a cot bed, waiting, it seemed, for some weary
child to crawl in between its warm blankets.&nbsp; Azalea took
off her worn and dusty shoes and her disgraceful frock, and
stretched herself between the comforts.&nbsp; The next moment she
was sound asleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>A few hours later, the Sisson All Star Combination, rattling
down the mountain side, came upon the wagon and the tent of Betty
Bowen, ranged side by side in a comfortable little pocket away
back from the road&mdash;the same road that Azalea had taken a
mile lower down, after her hurried taking of the short cuts.</p>
<p>Sisson greeted the encampment with a whoop, and brought Rafe,
shock-headed and heavy-eyed, from his bed of straw in the
wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sisson, &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t
getting up early to hang out the wash, be you?&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s Bet?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>Rafe
pointed at the tent with his thumb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In there, I reckon.&nbsp; We all sat late last night
around the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&nbsp; Mighty social, ain&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Had
any trouble with that girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rafe frowned and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, get &rsquo;em out of the tall grass,&rdquo;
commanded Sisson.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to see
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rafe went to the tent door and called, but Bet was sleeping
heavily, and her son, looking at her jaded face, hesitated to
arouse her.&nbsp; It was Azalea whom Sisson wanted to see, and
Rafe said to himself that Sisson would have to treat her well, or
there would be trouble.&nbsp; He could see the girl&rsquo;s bed
bunched up as if she were rolled underneath the bed clothes, but
when he called there was no answer, and at last, half frightened,
he went over to awaken her.&nbsp; But when he got closer he
discovered there was no one in the bed.&nbsp; The clothes were
tossed up as if some one lay there, and he saw at a glance that
they had been purposely made to look that way.&nbsp; For a minute
his heart sank; and then, suddenly, with a strange new
unselfishness, it lightened.&nbsp; Azalea had slipped from
Sisson&rsquo;s clutches after all.&nbsp; Rafe drew his belt a <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>little
tighter, pushed his hat on the back of his head, and going out,
faced the company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s lit out,&rdquo; he said briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; screamed Sisson.&nbsp; And before Rafe
could say more, a man&mdash;the tallest, it seemed to Rafe, that
he ever had set his eyes upon, came stalking around from behind
one of the wagons.&nbsp; He was hatless, and revealed a startling
shock of hair, and underneath his arm he carried a fiddle in its
case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you say, you speckled cub?&rdquo; he roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s lit out,&rdquo; Rafe repeated.&nbsp;
He grinned at them cheerfully, and was still grinning as Sisson
advanced with fight in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you onto your job any better than
that?&rdquo; he yelled, still coming on.&nbsp; Rafe looked almost
languid as he watched him, but just as Sisson got ready for a
rush at him, the great arm of the young mountaineer shot forward,
striking his &ldquo;boss&rdquo; cleanly between the eyes.&nbsp;
And down in the dust went the head of the Sisson All Star
Combination.&nbsp; Every one except the man with the violin
laughed.&nbsp; He seemed hardly to have noticed Sisson&rsquo;s
downfall.&nbsp; He turned his <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>piercing eyes on the young man and
said in a voice as cold and keen as a sword-edge:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me where the girl is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That new, strange gathering of little good angels conspired
again to make Rafe answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&nbsp; She went into that tent
last night.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the last I seen of her.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t set the dog to watch last night&mdash;I got tired of
treating that little thing like she was a convict.&nbsp; So
she&rsquo;s slipped away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something very like applause came from the All Stars, and it
grew a little louder as Bet, having been awakened by the noise,
appeared at the door.&nbsp; They were giving her credit, she
understood, for having connived at the child&rsquo;s escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she may be near at hand,&rdquo; continued the man
with the fiddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon not, sir.&nbsp; Her bed was fixed up to look
like she was in it.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s lit out all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll do the same,&rdquo; said Haystack
Thompson.&nbsp; He reached in one of the wagons and drew out a
few clothes tied in a square of homespun.&nbsp; &ldquo;So long,
folks,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy
yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The All Stars stared and forgot their manners, so that
&ldquo;Haystack&rdquo; had to make his way <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>on down the
mountain with no one to say goodbye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he was spying out the girl the whole time!&rdquo;
said they to each other.</p>
<p>But what they thought or knew was of no consequence to
Haystack now.&nbsp; He swung on down the road, peering here and
there, and hallooing at the top of his lungs every few
minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zalie!&nbsp; Zalie McBirney!&rdquo; he shouted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where you hiding?&nbsp; This is ole Haystack come to take
you home.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be afeard, Zalie.&nbsp; Answer up,
that&rsquo;s a good girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no answer came; and a couple of hours later when he had
reached the contented little town of Barrington, he went to the
telegraph office and with the help of the obliging young operator
sent this message to Mr. Carson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found the third wagon, but not the girl.&nbsp; Search
party going out to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
THE SUMMERS FAMILY</h2>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Absalom Summers, pastor of the Methodist church
at Barrington, N. C., got up out of his bed singing.&nbsp; He
went to his bath singing, and singing he hastened to the kitchen
to build the fire for breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mighty fortress is our Lord,&rdquo; he shouted to the
clear, bright morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bulwark nev-ev-er fail-ll-ing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not even stop singing when he knocked his head against
the shed door.&nbsp; Indeed, he would have felt a little lonesome
if he had not hit it against that jamb, for that battering of his
blond head was a part, so to speak of the morning ritual.&nbsp;
He loomed six feet three in his knitted hose, and as the door was
only six feet in height, difficulties of one sort or another were
unavoidable.&nbsp; As yet, the door casing had resisted all
attacks.&nbsp; All the Rev. Absalom said was &ldquo;Ouch!&nbsp;
Giminy cricket!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then with increased vigor he
continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>&ldquo;Our helper he, amid the flood <br />
Of mortal ills pre-vail-ll-ing.<br />
For still our ancient foe,<br />
Doth seek to work us woe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The song died&mdash;not on the lips of the reverend gentleman,
for to say that he sang with his lips would be to do him an
injustice.&nbsp; The song died in his resounding throat and his
massive lungs, it faded away in his deep diaphragm, and he stood
frankly gasping.</p>
<p>The morning being so fair, it had called to him, and even with
his arms laden with good &ldquo;light wood,&rdquo; he could not
resist the temptation to step out on the little porch to look at
the lacy clouds winding over an azure sky, and the delicate
scarfs of mist fluttering from the shoulders of the
mountains.&nbsp; And then he saw just what papa bear and mamma
bear and baby bear saw when they came back to their home.&nbsp;
He saw Golden-locks, or rather Hazel-locks, asleep in the little
couch.&nbsp; She was smiling as if she were dreaming of happy
things, but for all of that she looked very worn and uncared
for.&nbsp; The shoes that stood beside the cot had almost no
soles to them, and the soiled white frock that lay <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>tumbled at
the foot of the bed, was a mere rag.&nbsp; Her long hair was
uncared for, and the deep rings beneath her eyes were not all
from fatigue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he under his breath, &ldquo;the poor
little thrush&mdash;the little storm-blown thrush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he rushed away, because he felt a great need upon
him, which was to tell his wife Barbara what had happened.&nbsp;
It was nothing less than a pain to him to know anything that
Barbara did not know.&nbsp; So he emptied his arms of the wood,
and dashed back to the bedroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he commanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come!&rdquo;&nbsp; His greenish eyes were shining with the
loving light that was almost always to be seen in them, his face,
as quick with expressions as an actor&rsquo;s, was literally
beaming, and he was gesticulating with his large hands.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just come, mamma, quick,&rdquo; he pleaded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t stop to do your hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me go too!&nbsp; Me go too!&rdquo; piped the insistent,
high-pitched voice of the young person in the cradle.&nbsp; So
without more ado, the Rev. Absalom gathered his son in his arms,
and the three Summers made an excursion to the back porch.&nbsp;
There they stood&mdash;at least there two of them stood, and
there the third, safe under his dad&rsquo;s arm,
wriggled&mdash;and looked at the little <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>forlorn,
sleeping beauty.&nbsp; Then, because Mrs. Barbara had a way of
finding the right word, she sighed happily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How winsome!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then &ldquo;How
forlorn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clean beat out,&rdquo; agreed the Rev. Absalom.&nbsp;
Barbara put a finger on her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her sleep,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She shall
sleep as long as she can, and after that, we&rsquo;ll see
what&rsquo;s to be done.&nbsp; Best lock the shed door, dear, so
she can&rsquo;t get away without our knowing it.&nbsp; She might
be frightened, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband smiled his broadest smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;d be very much
frightened,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got too much
sense.&nbsp; Now, if I was lost, or had run away from home,
I&rsquo;d never have the sense to nose out a bed and get into
it.&nbsp; Not I.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be lying out in the rain
groaning and sighing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see you groaning and sighing,&rdquo; retorted
his wife, pinching his arm as she took the baby from him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d take a crowbar and break in the front door of
the first house you came to, and then you&rsquo;d bless all the
people in the house and crawl in the best bed and go to
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>She
ran with the baby in her arms, away from his pretended anger, and
he turned his attention once more to the kitchen fire, singing
under his breath:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And though this world with demons
filled,<br />
Should threaten to undo-oo-oo us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world might be filled with demons, but it was quite
evident that they had not succeeded in breaking into the house of
the Rev. Absalom Summers.&nbsp; They had not put their clutches
on his little brown wife nor on his golden-haired baby son.&nbsp;
They were not in the bright little kitchen, where she hastily
prepared the morning meal, and they did not sit down at the table
with the family while the head of the house said grace in clear
and decisive tones which could leave no chance for any
inattention on the part of Providence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear Master of the World and of this little
house,&rdquo; prayed the good man, &ldquo;we thank Thee for this
bright morning and for the flowers and clouds and birds which
have helped to make it beautiful.&nbsp; We thank Thee that we,
here beneath this roof, love each other with whole hearts.&nbsp;
We thank Thee for the little child that sits here at our board,
and for his health and <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>smiles, and from the bottom of our
hearts we pray Thee to give us wisdom to lead him in the paths of
goodness.&nbsp; And we thank Thee for the little wanderer who
sleeps a stranger in our house.&nbsp; If she be motherless, give
us joy in mothering her; and if she be fatherless, we commit her
to Thy all knowing care&mdash;beg for her Thy abounding love and
mercy.&nbsp; May no fear come in her heart when first she looks
upon us.&nbsp; May she see at once the tenderness we feel for
her.&nbsp; And if it be Thy will that she shall unite her life
with ours, may we have heart of grace to take her as a gift from
Thee.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; breathed Mrs. Barbara, wiping her
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; laughed baby Jonathan.</p>
<p>And then they all fell to and ate with the best of
appetites.</p>
<p>Then, while they lingered over their meal, and the Rev.
Absalom talked about the ride he ought to take to Sessions to see
old Mrs. Underwood, who had cancer, and while Mrs. Barbara
decided that perhaps she&rsquo;d better not start her blue chally
that day when she was likely to have so much on her mind, and
while baby Jonathan was wondering when, <i>when</i> he would be
let <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>down
on the floor to crawl after that nice hairy caterpillar, there
came a great knocking at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Bill Jones!&rdquo; cried the preacher.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a fist the man has!&nbsp; Who can it be,
Barbara?&rdquo;&nbsp; It was no easy matter for the master of the
house to uncoil his long legs and get them out from under the
table.&nbsp; So it was little Mrs. Barbara who opened the door to
admit a man quite as tall as her own Absalom&mdash;a man with no
hat and a great shock of hair, and a fiddle under his arm.&nbsp;
He nodded to Mrs. Summers, but looked over her head at the man
and shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neighbor, I&rsquo;m getting up a posse to hunt a little
girl that&rsquo;s been lost.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s mighty important
that we get under way inside of an hour at the farthest.&nbsp;
Will you join us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you just make up your mind I will, man.&nbsp; But
first I want to know why she&rsquo;s lost, and who wants her, and
what&rsquo;s to be done with her after she&rsquo;s found.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve known of cases where it was better to be lost than
found.&nbsp; What say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say what you say is true, sir!&nbsp; It would be a
heap better for that there little girl to die on the mountains
alone than to be picked up by the <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>folks she&rsquo;s run away
from.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t want them to get her, and I
don&rsquo;t want her to die on the mountain side, for
there&rsquo;s happiness a-coming to her if only I can put my
hands on her and take her back to them that&rsquo;s waiting for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Summers was at last untangled from the table and he came
forward holding out that great hearty hand which had put faith
and hope into many weary hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, neighbor, you do me the honor to enter and be
seated, if you please.&nbsp; I want to get the rights of this
story before I do anything.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;re wasting time, for I give you my word that
you&rsquo;re saving it, and that as soon as I find this is a
thing we all ought to enlist in, I&rsquo;ll have the whole town
about us&mdash;baying at our heels, sir&mdash;and it will be view
and halloo with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haystack Thompson shifted his violin to his other arm, and ran
a long tongue over his lips.&nbsp; Then he looked over his
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You the preacher?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came in then, and at Mrs. Summer&rsquo;s invitation to draw
his chair up to the breakfast table, did so, and ate while he
told his story.&nbsp; From <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>time to time the Rev. Absalom
consulted his wife Barbara.&nbsp; He had a way of lifting an
eyebrow or half closing an eye, that was a code of signals in
itself; and she had her own swift ways of answering.&nbsp; So
that by the time Haystack was through with his story, both Mr.
and Mrs. Summers had decided what to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You show him,&rdquo; said Mr. Summers.&nbsp; So Mrs.
Barbara arose and beckoned their visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need of a searching party, sir,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come see what we found this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, just as the two of them stepped out onto the porch,
Azalea opened her weary eyes and blinked at the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, praise the Lord!&rdquo; broke from
Haystack&rsquo;s lips when he saw her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; shouted the Rev. Absalom, and in spite of
some effort to restrain himself he broke out with:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Prince of darkness grim,<br />
We tremble not for him;<br />
His rage we can endure,<br />
For lo! his doom is sure.<br />
One little word shall fell-ll-ll him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>Azalea sat up on her cot with the bedclothes drawn up
to her chin, and stared about her with eyes too full of surprise
to be troubled.&nbsp; Then, with a rush, she comprehended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Thompson, dear!&rdquo; she gasped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is it really you?&nbsp; Oh, Mr. Thompson!&rdquo;&nbsp; She
forgot her uncovered arms and her straggling hair, and sprang
from her couch into the old fiddler&rsquo;s outstretched arms,
and wept.&nbsp; It was not a mere summer shower, but a
cloudburst&mdash;a freshet.&nbsp; And Haystack Thompson wept too,
and mopped his eyes on his red bandana; and the Rev. Absalom
Summers mopped his on the roller towel; and little Mrs. Summers
dried hers delicately on the hem of the baby&rsquo;s frock.&nbsp;
But, however, it became necessary to bring all this to an end,
and Haystack found the courage to do it.&nbsp; He set the little
girl down firmly in a chair and shook a warning finger at
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Storm&rsquo;s all over!&rdquo; he announced; and he
helped Mrs. Summers to wrap her pink knitted shawl around the
girl&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;to send word
to the folks at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; declared the
preacher.</p>
<p>Mrs. Summers ran to the window to see the <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>two tall
men making their way down the street, and then hastened back to
her strange guest.&nbsp; Azalea had arisen and came forward with
the pink shawl dragging behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she pleaded, both hands
extended, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t think me bold and
horrid.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not bold, honest I&rsquo;m not.&nbsp; I
want to tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all about it now, my dear, and I understand
everything.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think you are bold, and I&rsquo;m
very thankful that you came here.&nbsp; And now, my child, you
will find some clean clothes laid out on the bed&mdash;for you
and I are just about of a size, though I&rsquo;m a married person
and you&rsquo;re a little girl.&nbsp; And here&rsquo;s a glass of
milk to go on, so to speak, while you are making yourself
fine.&nbsp; By the time you are ready, there&rsquo;ll be more
porridge cooked for you.&nbsp; You like porridge, don&rsquo;t
you&mdash;with cream?&nbsp; And do you like muffins with raisins
in them?&nbsp; I can cook some in no time.&nbsp; And
bacon&mdash;shall it be bacon&mdash;and a few fried
potatoes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Azalea had fled to make her toilet.&nbsp; It was, after
all, not so quickly made as she might have hoped.&nbsp; As she
stood in the simple, dainty room, with the pretty toilet table
and the <a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>delicately perfumed soap and the great soft towels, all
her longing for the cleanliness of the Ma McBirney days came over
her, and when she emerged, at last, the muffins were as brown as
nuts on top, and the bacon was done to a crisp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Summers when she saw the girl
in her starched pink gingham, with smooth braids and
&ldquo;shining morning face&rdquo; standing in the doorway.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;&nbsp; The word seemed to mean much.&nbsp; It
meant among other things that Mrs. Barbara liked the looks of her
unexpected guest, and Azalea felt a pleasant wave of
&ldquo;homeyness&rdquo; gently rippling over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now for breakfast,&rdquo; said little Mrs.
Barbara.&nbsp; But at that moment Azalea saw what she thought was
the sweetest thing her eyes ever had beheld.&nbsp; Baby Jonathan
was in his tub down before the fire, and he was splashing with
hands and feet till the water flew all about him on the blue
oilcloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the little deary dear!&rdquo; squealed Azalea,
forgetting all about breakfast and dropping on her knees beside
the rosy baby.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, the little lovey, ducky,
honey-pot!&rdquo;&nbsp; She dropped a kiss at the back of his
neck, and then deposited one in each of his moist, rosy
palms.&nbsp; She twisted his <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>golden, silk-fine ringlets about her
finger, and counted his toes and his fingers to the immemorial
rhyme of the little pig that went to market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear,&rdquo; protested the baby&rsquo;s mother,
&ldquo;your breakfast is getting cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know, Mrs. Summers.&nbsp; But I like it
cold.&nbsp; I do, really, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; And then I&rsquo;ve
had ever so many breakfasts&mdash;Oh, ever and ever so many in my
time.&nbsp; But I never saw a baby before, close too, and like
this.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know they were so sweet.&nbsp; Why,
he&rsquo;s the very loveliest thing I ever saw.&nbsp; Are all
babies as nice as this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Barbara beamed, and her dark eyes looked deeper and
sweeter than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think there are any quite as
nice,&rdquo; she said blushing beautifully.&nbsp; &ldquo;But so
far as I&rsquo;ve seen they&rsquo;re all more or less
nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think everybody would have &rsquo;em!&rdquo;
cried Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;I certainly shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said little Mrs. Barbara
tenderly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now come, you starved child, and eat
your breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Azalea ate, she and Mrs. Summers exchanged
confidences.&nbsp; Azalea told her the full story of her
&ldquo;strange life&rdquo; as she called it; and <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>Mrs.
Summers told her about her happy girlhood, and her days away at
boarding school, and how her parents had wished her to marry a
young man who lived near them, and whom she had known all her
life, and who was rich and of high social position, and how she
had just had to marry Absalom Summers who had no money, and who
didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;or care&mdash;what you meant when you
talked about a social position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m so happy,&rdquo; said the
clergyman&rsquo;s little wife, &ldquo;in this dear funny little
house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with that dear funny little baby,&rdquo; broke in
Azalea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I really can&rsquo;t be thankful enough,&rdquo;
concluded Mrs. Summers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Azalea, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d be
surprised if you could know of the perfectly lovely people
I&rsquo;ve been meeting these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Bet Bowen and her son?&rdquo; teased Mrs.
Summers.</p>
<p>Azalea flushed a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;But really and truly,
they had their good side, Mrs. Summers,&rdquo; she said
earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t half as bad to me as
they might have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear child!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure they
weren&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>perhaps in their hearts they are
glad you got away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea clasped her hands and swung them up over her head with
a curious, excited gesture.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can make up your
mind that I&rsquo;m glad, Mrs. Summers.&nbsp; Just think,
I&rsquo;m really free again, and I&rsquo;m going back to Ma
McBirney, and Carin and all the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baby had been taken from its bath and clothed in fresh
garments, and now its mother made herself comfortable in a low
rocking chair, and drew the fuzzy head against her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to rock him to sleep,&rdquo; she
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll have to stop talking a
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea smiled till all of her teeth gleamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I know it
will be hard.&nbsp; Honest, I never talked so much before in my
life.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always been afraid of people a little, or
thought it wasn&rsquo;t polite to talk like this.&nbsp; But
someway&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mind my saying it, do you, Mrs.
Summers?&mdash;you seem almost like my own sister.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t <i>help</i> talking to you.&nbsp; You may be
married and older than I am, but <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>you&rsquo;re no bigger.&nbsp; And
then you&rsquo;ve been so good&mdash;so good I couldn&rsquo;t
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh, dear,&rdquo; murmured the little mother.&nbsp; And
she crooned the baby to sleep while the girl, sitting on a
hassock near, watched her with admiring eyes.</p>
<p>Then, when baby was quiet, the two worked together about the
little house till all was tidy and as it should be, and little
Mrs. Summers made her confession too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get dreadfully lonely at times,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The people here are good as good can be, but
they&rsquo;re different from the people I&rsquo;m used to.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t seem to make myself feel quite free with
them.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ve told you more, Azalea, than I have
them, and I&rsquo;ve only known you such a little, little few
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Azalea
softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very queer.&nbsp; I know this:
I&rsquo;ll have you for my kin as long as I live.&nbsp; You see
I&rsquo;ve no real kin, so we&rsquo;ll be pretend kin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cousins!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Barbara.&nbsp; &ldquo;Make
it cousins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cousins!&rdquo; cried Azalea in turn.&nbsp; And they
smiled at each other from across the bed that they were making
together.</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>So
Haystack Thompson, still somewhat troubled and flustered, came
back to find his charge as happy as a bird.&nbsp; And it was
arranged that they should take the train for Lee that
afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to wear the things you have on,
Azalea,&rdquo; said Mrs. Summers.&nbsp; &ldquo;And my blue
sunshade, and you can send them back to me when you get
ready.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve ten times as many clothes as I have any
occasion to wear here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there were still several hours that these so sudden
friends could spend together; so Azalea was shown the garden and
the chickens and the cow and the one lazy white horse, and she
was present when Jonathan awoke.&nbsp; She saw him dewy from his
sleep, and thought him lovelier than ever.&nbsp; So it was not
quite easy to say goodbye when the time came.&nbsp; But it was
agreed that Mrs. Summers was to write to Azalea and that Azalea
was to answer, and that they were to address each other as
&ldquo;My dear Cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four o&rsquo;clock train bore Haystack Thompson and Azalea
away from the little huddled town and up through the purple
mountains, and dropped them, after hours of unexpected delay,
down into the village of Lee.</p>
<h2><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>CHAPTER XII<br />
MA SAYS NO</h2>
<p>Ma McBirney, sitting sad-eyed at the edge of the mountain
plateau on which her cottage stood, was absently watching the
road.&nbsp; She had no reason to suppose that anybody would be
winding up that five-mile wagonway to see her, yet for some
reason she could not fix her mind on her work that morning.&nbsp;
Sitting there at the &ldquo;Outlook,&rdquo; she could see over
the bright valley and catch the gleam of the sun on the river and
on the distant dome of the county courthouse.</p>
<p>About her the bees hummed, intent on their day&rsquo;s work;
and not far distant stood the buzzing village of hives which
Thomas McBirney had placed where the Pride of India tree, the
mimosas and catalpas, the trumpet flower and wild honeysuckle
could feed them.&nbsp; Mary McBirney loved the song of the bees;
she loved the bright valley; she loved her home and most of all
she loved those within it.</p>
<p>Yet to-day the heart in her was heavy.&nbsp; A <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>sorrow less
black yet somehow more disheartening than that which had engulfed
her at the time of her Molly&rsquo;s death, rested upon her
heart.&nbsp; When Molly had died, it was as if the tragic
blackness of night had come upon her.&nbsp; Yet amid this murk
there came shining the morning star of hope.&nbsp; And afterward
there came the full and beautiful dawn of perfect trust.&nbsp;
She believed that in the Time to Come she and Molly would stand
together, spirit to spirit, and that there would be no more
separation.</p>
<p>Then Azalea had come to fill the lonely hours with her bright
ways, and every night Mary McBirney had thanked God for her
daughterly society.&nbsp; And now she was gone!&nbsp; Nor could
the woman who had grown to love her, rest in the comfort that she
was, like Molly, safe from harm.&nbsp; When Molly died, her
mother&rsquo;s grief had been selfish.&nbsp; She did not mourn
for Molly, but for herself.&nbsp; But now she mourned most for
the lost girl, who might be going through terrible experiences,
and who was, no doubt, eating out her heart in terror and
homesickness.</p>
<p>There were not wanting those who said&mdash;and
believed&mdash;that the &ldquo;circus girl&rdquo; had run away of
her own accord and gone back to the <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>wandering folk with whom she had
spent the greater part of her life.&nbsp; But never for one
fleeting second did Ma McBirney think this.&nbsp; She had looked
too often into the clear and loving eyes of the girl, to believe
that there could be anything about her which was not
straightforward and loyal.&nbsp; She only prayed that in some way
her love might reach out, as starlight reaches from stars, to
shine on the poor wandering child and comfort her.</p>
<p>She could see her Thomas working on his terraced, steep
fields, and now and then she waved a hand to him.&nbsp; She
didn&rsquo;t want him to know how heavily her heart lay in
her.&nbsp; She had caused him enough anxiety during the past
year, and she knew his own heart was sore with the loss of his
Molly, and that he also was greatly distressed over Azalea.&nbsp;
So, not to add to his troubles, she tried to wear a cheerful
face.&nbsp; But this morning her knees seemed to give way under
her, and her pulse fluttered sickeningly.</p>
<p>Then, as she sat there reproaching herself for not having more
faith that her eager prayers would be answered, she saw three
riders coming up the long road.&nbsp; They showed in the midst of
a little clearing and then were lost among the <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>trees, and
only now and then, at some bald, out-jutting point, could she
catch a glimpse of them.&nbsp; After a time she made out that
they were a man, a woman and a girl; and when they were still far
beneath her, she recognized them for Mr. and Mrs. Carson and
Carin.</p>
<p>She threw a thought to the cabin and the way it looked, and
decided that nothing was out of place.&nbsp; All was as orderly
and clean as hands could make it, and up in Azalea&rsquo;s empty
room, there were fresh flowers in the vase, and the canary bird
was singing on the little high-swung gallery.&nbsp; As for Ma
McBirney herself, she always was neat.&nbsp; Her hair rippled
away from her broad, low brow, and her plain gingham frock, with
its crocheted collar and its branched coral brooch, was as clean
and smooth as it could be made.&nbsp; So, unflurried as
ever&mdash;though she had never before received people so
important&mdash;Mrs. McBirney awaited her guests.</p>
<p>The three of them, having achieved the last climb on their
way, urged their horses to a fine gallop, and they came bearing
down tumultuously on Mary McBirney, crying out something
joyously.&nbsp; Then, suddenly she forgot all <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>her dignity
and ran to meet them, and as they reined up sharply by her side
the tears were streaming over her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say?&nbsp; What say?&rdquo; she shrilled at
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is she found!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found!&nbsp; Whoop la!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Carson like a
boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Found by Haystack Thompson.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
all safe and right&mdash;safe and right as Carin here.&nbsp; And
they&rsquo;re coming home on the afternoon train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; gasped Mrs. McBirney, and sank down on a
convenient stump and stared in the distance, the unheeded tears
still running down her cheeks.&nbsp; And then rousing herself she
cried: &ldquo;But the boys must know!&nbsp; Pa must
know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa&rsquo;s cultivating the cotton patch yon; and
Hi&rsquo;s fishing&mdash;it don&rsquo;t take but one arm to fish,
you know.&nbsp; And Jim&rsquo;s off at school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count Jim out, then, Mrs. McBirney.&nbsp; Shall I go
call the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a way,&rdquo; cried Mrs.
McBirney, and sped toward the house.&nbsp; There she kept an old
horn hanging.&nbsp; It had come down in the family from
Revolutionary times; it had been used to call the men in from the
fields, when the <a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>hostile Indians showed their feathered heads above the
pass, and now it blew its good tidings over the fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will bring them,&rdquo; said Mrs. McBirney.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll come running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Carsons said they would sit out in the sunshine&mdash;that
there was no need for them to go into the house.&nbsp; They had
come up unexpectedly, and they gave Mary McBirney a chance to
keep her house to herself if she wished.&nbsp; But a kind of
humble pride swelled in the good woman&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; She
had not many vanities, but her pride in her home was one of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will sit in the sun,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for
it&rsquo;s the place to be days like this.&nbsp; But first you
must see my home.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen yours, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they were shown the homely rooms&mdash;the rooms where each
and every member of the family had his comfortable place.&nbsp;
They saw the cat sunning on the doorstep, and the hounds
stretched out in the yard.&nbsp; They saw the braided rugs, the
woven counterpanes, the homemade cotton at the windows, the
shapely baskets, all the products of Mary McBirney&rsquo;s busy
hands.</p>
<p>And then they were taken to that clean little <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>chamber,
looking straight up the leafy mountain side, which the McBirneys
had lovingly made for Azalea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Carin, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a dear
place, mamma?&nbsp; Quaint and dear like Azalea!&nbsp; My room
has too many things in it, hasn&rsquo;t it mamma?&nbsp; I like
this better.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s almost like living in the tree
tops.&nbsp; The next time Azalea leaves you, Mrs. McBirney, it
will be because she thinks she&rsquo;s a bird and flies
away.&nbsp; Or else she&rsquo;ll be a flying squirrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And just then they heard Thomas McBirney calling them from
below.&nbsp; Then they all went down to have a part in telling
their good news, and while they were in the very midst of their
story&mdash;not that they had much to tell, for they knew no more
than Haystack&rsquo;s message had brought them&mdash;Hi&rsquo;s
odd little figure, with its long arms and bullet head, came
crawling up the rocks from the lower waterfall.&nbsp; His dark
face was strangely old and tired, and as he moved forward, with
one of his thin arms in a splint, he certainly looked like a
neglected boy, and this in spite of all that Ma McBirney could do
to keep him as she thought a boy should be kept.</p>
<p><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s found, Hi,&rdquo; Mr. Carson shouted
in his hearty way.&nbsp; &ldquo;Azalea is found!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest, sir?&rdquo; cried Hi, stumbling forward.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Honest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest Injun, hope to die!&rdquo; roared back Mr.
Carson.</p>
<p>Hi began kicking viciously at the dirt and twisting his body
this way and that.&nbsp; He was in agony for fear he would
&ldquo;boo hoo,&rdquo; as he put it to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sap head!&rdquo; he snarled under his breath,
&ldquo;Mammy&rsquo;s baby boy!&rdquo;&nbsp; He was calling
himself names, and to some effect, for the invisible hand that
had clutched his throat seemed to relax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Carson, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go sit
out there on the headland and talk.&nbsp; We rode up here to-day
not only to tell you this perfectly gorgeous piece of news, but
also to talk over certain matters with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re pleased to listen to
anything you have to say, sir,&rdquo; replied Thomas McBirney
quaintly.&nbsp; So they seated themselves on the benches at
&ldquo;Outlook Point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are so,&rdquo; murmured Ma McBirney in her soft
voice.</p>
<p><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you begin at the beginning,
Lucy?&rdquo; said Mr. Carson to his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell them
how we came to leave the city and our friends and all, and settle
here.&nbsp; Or shall I tell them, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carson leaned back against the trunk of a tulip tree and
looked off across the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a great sorrow,&rdquo; she said in her weary,
beautiful way.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a sorrow so great that we
never could quite believe it.&rdquo;&nbsp; She spoke slowly, with
a little pause between each word.&nbsp; &ldquo;In one day our
three sons were taken from us.&nbsp; It was at a
theatre&mdash;there was a fire&mdash;I never talk of it.&nbsp; I
cannot.&nbsp; We have traveled; we have lived here and there, and
we have been unable to get back our strength and interest.&nbsp;
My Charles&mdash;&rdquo; she laid her white hand on her
husband&rsquo;s knee&mdash;&ldquo;tries to make out that he
has.&nbsp; But I know better.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s more unselfish
than I, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Sometimes I&rsquo;ve shut myself
up for weeks at a time, and seen no one except my nurse.&nbsp; It
was the only way that I could control myself.&nbsp; Well, not to
talk of that, we have come, naturally enough, to look at life in
a very different way from what we used to look at it.&nbsp; We
see that we&rsquo;ve got to stop living for ourselves
alone.&nbsp; If we&rsquo;re to be happy again, we must <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>enlarge our
family.&nbsp; We must take in everyone we can reach who needs us,
or who will care for us.&nbsp; So we have come down here where
every one seems simple and friendly, and where we can offer our
neighborly offices, to spend the next few years.&nbsp; We heard
of the fine old Atherton place, and finding that it was for sale,
we bought it and have made a home there which we really are
coming to love, though we had thought we never could really care
for a home again.&nbsp; And now we want to be doing
something&mdash;something really interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to play a new game,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Carson,
&ldquo;and to get as many as we can to come and play with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Carson, &ldquo;to go into
these mountain industries.&nbsp; We want the old handicrafts to
be revived; the weaving, the basket making and the pottery.&nbsp;
And we want your help and advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; cried Mary McBirney
enthusiastically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thomas and I have talked many and
many&rsquo;s the time, of the good that might come from such a
thing.&nbsp; Why, there&rsquo;s chair makers in these parts that
can make a chair <a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>that&rsquo;ll go down to their
great-great-grandchildren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the thing, just the thing, madam!&rdquo; answered
Mr. Carson.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got the knowledge, and
they&rsquo;ve the talent, but they don&rsquo;t use their
knowledge sufficiently, and they don&rsquo;t understand how to
market their wares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Mr. McBirney admitted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re poorer than Job&rsquo;s turkey.&nbsp; They
just set around and mourn their fate.&nbsp; They stir up a little
patch of ground, and think they&rsquo;ve done everything there is
to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re too far from markets and
railroads,&rdquo; said Mr. Carson.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the beginning
the mountains called them, they were so beautiful; and then they
cast a spell over them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as if the people were
hypnotized, and hadn&rsquo;t leave to move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. McBirney.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You see them creeping down into town as shy as deer.&nbsp;
And you can tell by looking at them, that there ain&rsquo;t
enough in the pantry to go around.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re just plumb
starved, that&rsquo;s what they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starved for lack of food, and society, and
excitement,&rdquo; Mr. Carson added.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>stomachs
and their minds and hearts are empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, just plumb empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s put something in them.&nbsp; What do
you say, Mr. McBirney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly would be a fine thing to do, sir.&nbsp;
Now, how&rsquo;ll you go about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we want you and Mrs. McBirney to co-operate with
us.&nbsp; We want you to take charge of the chair factory that we
mean to start, and we want Mrs. McBirney to preside over the
weaving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave the farm, sir?&rdquo; cried Mary
McBirney.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not ever meaning that, are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, would that be so hard?&nbsp; We&rsquo;d put you up
just the sort of cottage you want, you know.&nbsp; And
you&rsquo;d be near the school, so that Jim could go without
using up the best part of his energy racing up and down the
mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon Jimmy does get rather wore out,&rdquo; Mary
McBirney mused.&nbsp; &ldquo;And maybe it would be better all
&rsquo;round, Mr. Carson.&nbsp; And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary McBirney&rsquo;s eyes strayed off to the purple valley
with its silver streams; they rested on the low-lying cottage,
wreathed in its flowering vines and hemmed around with its rose
bushes, <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>its sweet althea shrubs, its hydrangeas and bridal
wreaths; they rested on the Pride of India tree and the graves
beneath; on the towering tulip trees under which they sat, and
she shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Carson,&rdquo; she said gently and with the
moisture gathering in her eyes, &ldquo;we couldn&rsquo;t never
make another place so&mdash;so sweet&mdash;as this here
one.&nbsp; We couldn&rsquo;t put our hearts into another place as
we have into this.&nbsp; Besides, though I thank you kindly, sir,
I wouldn&rsquo;t want to leave my home to work outside.&nbsp; My
job is making things bright for Thomas and Jim and Azalea, and
perhaps for Hi, here.&nbsp; If it was so that I really needed to
work outside, of course I would and never say a word.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;d rather we got along with little, and went patched and
mended, than for us to have more and lose the feeling of
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say the farm has paid any too
well,&rdquo; Thomas McBirney said, &ldquo;Sometimes it certainly
has been hard scratching.&nbsp; And yet, somehow, I
wouldn&rsquo;t like to cut loose from it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s such a
likely prospect we have here.&rdquo;&nbsp; He too was looking off
at the valley.&nbsp; &ldquo;Somehow it don&rsquo;t seem as if we
could move on.&nbsp; Perhaps the <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>mountains <i>have</i> cast a spell
over us, as you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t blame you if they have,&rdquo; said
Mr. Carson cordially.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet ought you to let sentiment
like that stand in the way of Jim&rsquo;s schooling and your
advancement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas McBirney crossed one leg over the other, and looked
down pensively at his calloused hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I had ought to,&rdquo; he said
slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But after all, we&rsquo;re happy here.&nbsp;
The children was born here.&nbsp; Our little girl&mdash;Molly,
you know, that&rsquo;s dead&mdash;she seems to be running over
the place still.&nbsp; Seems like I can feel her near me, plenty
of times.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you feel that way, ma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary McBirney nodded, with her tender smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; went on Thomas McBirney, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know as I ought to leave.&nbsp; But I tell you what I
can do, Mr. Carson, and what I&rsquo;d be proud to do.&nbsp;
Times when I wasn&rsquo;t busy here at the farm, I could drive
back into the mountains to visit men I know, and men I
don&rsquo;t exactly know but that I&rsquo;ve heard tell of, and I
could get them to working on chairs for you.&nbsp; Then
they&rsquo;d haul them down to your place; and maybe some of <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>them who
ain&rsquo;t as hard to pry loose from the rocks as I be, will
move down beside your factory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thomas makes the best chairs I ever set in,&rdquo;
declared Mary McBirney with pride.&nbsp; &ldquo;Talk about
getting other men to make chairs!&nbsp; There ain&rsquo;t none of
them can come up to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I engage your whole output then,&rdquo; declared Mr.
Carson, apparently not at all vexed that his fine plan had been
disarranged.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get to work, Mr. McBirney, and get your
boy to work.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll sell the chairs for you at better
rates than you ever dreamed of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you do that,&rdquo; declared Thomas McBirney,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll take your commission.&nbsp; This has got to
be on a business basis, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; answered Mr. Carson
hastily.&nbsp; He saw that it would be very easy to hurt the
pride of this independent man.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll agree on
the commission, and I&rsquo;ll take it.&nbsp; Of course I shall
need money to build my cottages and to run the
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hi had been wriggling like a worm on the bench where he sat
beside Carin, and now, with much blinking and twisting, he
managed to say, addressing himself to Mr. Carson:</p>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>&ldquo;Please, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Hi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My ma, you know,&rdquo; but his cogs stopped again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t exactly know her, Hi, but I&rsquo;d
like to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can weave, sir, better than anybody.&nbsp; She can
weave the Tudor Rose, and the Andrew Jackson Cabin, and the
Diamond and Cat Track&mdash;Oh, most anything.&nbsp; You ought to
see her weaving.&nbsp; And she can make her own dyes, just
beautiful.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s the use?&nbsp; Where she lives
nobody cares about her weaving.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d just ask her
to come on, sir, since Mrs. McBirney don&rsquo;t want to,
she&rsquo;d run the place for you, fine, and teach the women all
the old patterns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His little black eyes seemed to hold flames in them as he
turned his face, twitching with his excitement, toward Mr.
Carson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Hi, could she really?&nbsp; Where does she
live?&nbsp; I can go and see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She lives away over on the far side of Steamboat
Mountain, sir.&nbsp; Pa&rsquo;s dead, you know, and there&rsquo;s
three children for ma to care for.&nbsp; She drives the horse to
town and gets washing, and she farms a little.&nbsp; But it
ain&rsquo;t much.&nbsp; I <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>had to leave home so&rsquo;s
I&rsquo;d not be making her feed me.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I
went away with my uncle Sisson.&rdquo;&nbsp; His face flushed
scarlet through all the brown as he thought of his connection
with this man whom he hated, and whom he knew all these people
with him held in contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall go with me, Hi, and show me the way.&nbsp; We
go by train, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By train first.&nbsp; Then we drive.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Little drops of sweat broke out on Hi&rsquo;s forehead and about
his mouth and the tears swam into his hot eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if we could be together, here, sir!&nbsp; I just
want to see my ma so!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been wanting to see her
all the time, and now since my arm got broke I can&rsquo;t hardly
live, I want her so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary McBirney reached out a hand and drew the boy over beside
her.&nbsp; He might have been ashamed of her petting at another
moment, but now he nestled up close to her, big boy that he was,
and looked shyly up into her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was being with you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he murmured,
&ldquo;that made me so homesick, I reckon.&nbsp; It made me
remember what ma was like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carson leaned forward to smile on him.</p>
<p><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have you and your mother together,
Hi,&rdquo; she declared, the languor gone out of her lovely
voice, &ldquo;one way or another.&nbsp; You may take my word for
that.&nbsp; And if, as you say, she can attend to the weaving,
why you may be sure she shall be given it to do.&nbsp; We can get
some one to help her keep her house and care for the
children.&nbsp; I agree with Mrs. McBirney, a mother has to make
a happy home.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s her first business&mdash;and her
best business, too, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; But since your mother
has to have the work outside in order to have a home, we&rsquo;ll
arrange the best we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall learn how to weave, too, mother,&rdquo; Carin
announced.&nbsp; &ldquo;O mother, can&rsquo;t I have that big
room upstairs for a studio?&nbsp; I want to put my sketches up on
the wall, and have a place to paint.&nbsp; Please, mother!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d be so happy if I could have a studio of my own.&nbsp;
If everyone else is to do something, I want to do something
too.&nbsp; And I know I can paint.&nbsp; And I know I can
weave.&nbsp; And I can make baskets.&nbsp; I have the dearest
ideas for shapes and designs.&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;d so much rather
do that than study arithmetic and grammar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there&rsquo;ll be time for both, my
dear,&rdquo; <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>smiled her mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;There seems to be a
great deal of time down here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m having a friend of
mine come down to act as governess for Carin,&rdquo; Mrs. Carson
said, turning to Mrs. McBirney.&nbsp; &ldquo;She will teach her
at home for the present, for I don&rsquo;t feel as if I could let
her go away to boarding school yet.&nbsp; Fortunately, my friend,
Miss Parkhurst, paints charmingly in water colors, and so Carin
will be able to take some lessons in that.&nbsp; Carin wants to
make an artist of herself, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d love to
have her if she really has the talent.&nbsp; Well, come, Charles,
we must be riding down the mountain.&nbsp; Will you meet Azalea
this afternoon, Mr. McBirney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just believe I will, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; declared
Thomas McBirney, going forward to hold Mrs. Carson&rsquo;s horse
for her.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it will be as happy an errand as I ever
took, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be pleased to see you often,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mrs. McBirney in her quaint way, as she
stood beside Mrs. Carson&rsquo;s beautiful white mare, looking up
into the delicate, lovely face of the woman above her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great privilege for me to know you,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the best things that has come to <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span><i>me</i>
to know you, Mary McBirney,&rdquo; responded the other, leaning
down to grasp the firm hand of her new friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
feel warmed all over when I&rsquo;m with you.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m
so glad you&rsquo;ve decided to keep inside your home.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m even glad that your husband has made up his mind to
stay up here on the mountain, though I must confess that it sets
back our plans a little.&nbsp; But it will all come out all
right.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll find some one who needs to come.&nbsp;
As for you&mdash;I mean &lsquo;you-all&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; she
laughed lightly, &ldquo;as you say, you&rsquo;re better right
here in this beautiful spot.&nbsp; Let me come often, will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come as often as you can, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; It
certainly will make me thankful to have you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mary
McBirney spoke from the heart.&nbsp; Idle compliments were not in
her line.&nbsp; She was offering her friendship, and Mrs. Carson,
who had known brilliant and charming women and had had their
devotion in plenty, felt her heart swell with satisfaction.&nbsp;
She had known lovely women, but never one in whose eyes the
lights of home seemed to glow as they did in Mary
McBirney&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Good-byes were said by all save Hi.&nbsp; He, it seemed, was
not to be found.&nbsp; He had slipped <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>away in his own fashion, and at that
moment he lay on the red pine needles back of the cabin,
&ldquo;just bawling,&rdquo; as he would have phrased it.</p>
<p>He was astonished at himself, and thoroughly disgusted.&nbsp;
He remembered that during all of his troubles, when Sisson beat
him, when he went hungry, when he lay out in the wet, he had not
once &ldquo;bawled.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seemed perfectly disgusting
that he should be doing it now when everything was coming all
right.</p>

236</span>CHAPTER XIII<br />
AT HOME AGAIN</h2>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock that afternoon, at which time the train
bearing Mr. Thompson and Azalea was due at Lee, Ma McBirney went
to the &ldquo;Outlook&rdquo; and fastened an old sheet in the
crotch of the tulip trees, and there being a fine breeze blowing
across the flank of the mountain, it caught the folds of this
copious flag and spread it to the breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Azalea will be the first to see it, likely,&rdquo;
thought Mrs. McBirney.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has such sharp
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the sharp eyes of Azalea were busy, at that moment,
staring disconsolately from the car window, many miles from
home.&nbsp; For there was a freight wreck not far ahead of them,
and, according to the conductor, there was no telling when they
could move on.</p>
<p>It was quite possible for Mary McBirney to hear the roar of
the approaching train from her high-swung home-nest, although the
railroad <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>lay across the valley from them, but Jim had come home
from school and heard all the story, and he and Hi had sat on the
bench and nearly stared their eyes out watching for the
locomotive to push its black nose over the gap, and supper had
been eaten, and the darkness settled down for the night, before
the shrill and apologetic whistle of the engine was heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That child will be clean starved,&rdquo; ma said to the
boys.&nbsp; &ldquo;And pa, too, unless he had the sense to go to
the inn and get supper.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t suppose he did,
me not being along.&nbsp; Seems like married men didn&rsquo;t
know enough to eat unless their wives was by to tell &rsquo;em
when to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not that Ma McBirney was scolding.&nbsp; She was merely
passing the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;d best take that there sheet in, ma,
and swing out the lantern,&rdquo; Jim said as he heard the
distant shriek of the train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure will cheer them up to see it,&rdquo; ma
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all ready for use, Jim.&nbsp; I
filled it and polished it yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Jim climbed up the tulip tree to the first long,
out-reaching branch, and swung out a serviceable headlight
lantern.</p>
<p><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Jim descending, &ldquo;It
looks like the morning star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it did to the homesick eyes of the girl who sat
snuggled close to Pa McBirney, sitting all starched and prim, in
the pink gingham frock of little Barbara Summers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, please?&rdquo; she cried, nudging
pa&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;That away up on the mountain?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s not a star, is it?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too low
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho!&rdquo; ejaculated pa, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
ma&rsquo;s lantern.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s telling us to hurry
up.&nbsp; You hear, you there?&rdquo; he called good-naturedly to
the horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the boys will come down to meet us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No they won&rsquo;t, Azalea.&nbsp; At least, Jim
won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll stay with his ma.&nbsp; As much as
we can, Azalea, we-all must stay with ma.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t
good for her to be alone too much.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been talking
that over with Jim and he thinks just like I do.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s had too much trouble, ma has, to be left alone to
brood over them.&nbsp; Not that she&rsquo;s a fretting one.&nbsp;
But she&rsquo;s deep, ma is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just seemed like her heart would break when you was
took away, Azalea.&nbsp; She sets great store by you&mdash;almost
as much as she did <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>by Molly.&nbsp; You see, she&rsquo;s turned the love
she had for Molly, right on you.&nbsp; So you be good to her,
sister, won&rsquo;t you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed I will!&nbsp; Just as good as I know
how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bright girl, Zalie, and I feel it in my
bones that there&rsquo;s fine things in store for you.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;m going to say right now, that if you can, I want you to
stick to ma.&nbsp; If you can, Azalea.&nbsp; Of course I
don&rsquo;t want you to stand in your own light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl slipped a hand into the arm of Pa McBirney.&nbsp;
Then she pointed up the valley to where the light shone from the
&ldquo;Outlook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my light, pa,&rdquo; she said softly.</p>
<p>Haystack Thompson, who had stayed in town for the night,
putting up at the inn and intending to return to his neglected
farm in the morning, had given Mr. McBirney an account of
Azalea&rsquo;s adventures, but now pa begged to hear them again
from the girl&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; So she told him everything in
her sweet wistful voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems like I&rsquo;m a dreadful lot of trouble to
you,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see why it is
that I had to bring you all this worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>&ldquo;Why tain&rsquo;t your fault, Zalie.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the use of talking like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems like I&rsquo;m not the way other girls
are.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had such a strange life, Pa
McBirney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well it hain&rsquo;t been very long yet,
girl&mdash;hardly long enough to be strange, you might
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes it has, pa.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been short and
strange.&nbsp; Now really, you know, I ought to be living in The
Shoals.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my house&mdash;at least, I mean it
might have been.&nbsp; That old Colonel Atherton you told Jim
about, and that he told me about, was my grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said it in a musing way, as if she attached very little
importance to it, and her hand still rested on the arm of Pa
McBirney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; roared pa.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
you saying, girl?&nbsp; Whoa there, Mac.&nbsp; Whoa
Nannie.&rdquo;&nbsp; He brought the horses to such a short stop
that the stones crashed away from hoofs and wheels down the steep
grade of the road.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just say that again, will
ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it out while I was away, pa.&nbsp; Betty Bowen
told me.&nbsp; She said mamma never wanted to come down this way,
so near her old home, until just at the last, when she knew she
couldn&rsquo;t <a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>live.&nbsp; But it don&rsquo;t matter, pa.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t think any less of me for being the granddaughter of
that man, do you?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help being related to him
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho!&rdquo; exclaimed pa.&nbsp; &ldquo;What you talking
about, girl?&nbsp; He may have been a foolish man in the heat of
all the trouble of the war, and done things that hadn&rsquo;t
ought to have been done, but he was quality, Azalea.&nbsp; They
was great folks, the Athertons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the only ones I know anything about,&rdquo; said
Azalea with a choke in her voice, &ldquo;were wandering show
folks; and one of them was a friendless orphan, Pa McBirney, till
you and ma took her in.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t any great folks
about her.&nbsp; There was just a miserable little wretch.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t change toward me, pa, please, please!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t go and tell Jim and Hi.&nbsp; Maybe they&rsquo;d
think I was putting on airs.&nbsp; Just let everything go on the
way it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing ever goes on the way it was,&rdquo; said pa
profoundly, clucking to his horses.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I see what
you mean, girl, and since you and me is pretty good friends,
I&rsquo;ll do what you want me to do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stand by
you because we are friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt the girl&rsquo;s grateful lips pressed against <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>the rough
sleeve of his coat, and he laughed down at her in a kindly,
almost pitying way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Zalie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
get to caring too much for us.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you get to
caring too much for nothing.&nbsp; You hear me?&nbsp; Keep calm,
Zalie.&nbsp; Keep calm.&nbsp; Folks that cares too much gets in a
lot of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they?&rdquo; laughed the girl.&nbsp; The remark
seemed to strike her as very funny, and her gay laughter rang out
like silver bells on the night air.&nbsp; The horses quickened
their steps as they heard it, and a discouraged looking old
&ldquo;houn&rsquo;-dog&rdquo; came out from a tumble-down cabin
and bayed at them.</p>
<p>But Pa McBirney refused to be amused.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean what
I say,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>Azalea pulled herself together and stopped laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m silly, pa, but I&rsquo;m so
happy!&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t think how happy I am!&nbsp; There
now, don&rsquo;t you try to tell me not to be too happy, because
I&rsquo;ve simply got to be happy to-night.&nbsp; Now, I&rsquo;ll
be good and talk like a sensible person all the rest of the
ride.&nbsp; I want to tell you more about Mr. Summers, and my
cousin Barbara.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>&ldquo;Your cousin Barbara?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Summers, you know.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s so
little she seems almost like a girl.&nbsp; And we made up our
minds to be kin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you did, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re going to write to each other
just like we were cousins.&nbsp; See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh-huh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just love her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t help it if I do.&nbsp; Tell me
about Carin, pa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon she&rsquo;ll be up to see you to-morrow to
tell you everything herself.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s going into some
kind of picture making, and her pa and ma is simply rooting up
the earth, doing things.&rdquo;&nbsp; He told her about the
project for developing the mountain industries and the part they
all were to play in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something laid out for every last one of us, you
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except me, pa.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t they make plans for
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t mention any, but I suspicion that
they&rsquo;ve got more plans for you than for anybody else.&nbsp;
And that makes me feel <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>kind o&rsquo; bothered, on
ma&rsquo;s account.&nbsp; Now that you tell me about your being
the granddaughter of old Colonel Atherton, with a sort of right
to live in the great house&mdash;though it did pass out of the
family years ago&mdash;I&rsquo;m more bothered than
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re bothered at all,
pa,&rdquo; she declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, here we are,
home!&nbsp; Why, we&rsquo;re really home!&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t the
time pass quickly?&nbsp; Ma!&nbsp; Ma!&nbsp; Hullo, boys!&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s ma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary McBirney folded the slight form of the girl in her
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My prayers was answered,&rdquo; she said simply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just bear witness, children.&nbsp; They was all
answered.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a lesson to us, ain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp;
If we want anything of the Lord, just ask him, believing.&nbsp;
Are you clean starved out, pet?&nbsp; Come right along in and
have supper.&nbsp; Pa, the boys will put up the horses.&nbsp; You
hike in the house and eat something decent.&nbsp; I suppose you
had some kind of stuff down at that there inn.&nbsp; My land,
it&rsquo;s a wonder to me them folks can&rsquo;t learn how to
cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led the girl in and seated her before the <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>table with
its fine bread, its glasses of foaming milk, its cottage cheese
and honey.&nbsp; Then she pushed her husband to his seat, and
hung over him, then fluttered to Azalea to hang over her like an
anxious mother bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a little hot ham to help quell your
appetites.&nbsp; And here&rsquo;s some hominy cakes.&nbsp; My
goodness, Azalea, do eat something.&nbsp; Pa, you just ruined
your appetite down there in that miserable eating place.&nbsp;
Ain&rsquo;t it wonderful to have Zalie home again, pa?&nbsp; The
ways of the Lord are past our comprehending.&nbsp; You must tell
me everything, Zalie&mdash;every last thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lights from the homemade candles fluttered softly against
the brown walls.&nbsp; Far off, the whippoorwills called.&nbsp;
The chill freshness of the night-enshrouded mountain stole in the
door, and when the boys had returned from putting up the horses,
the family shut out the silent, shadowy world about them and drew
around the table.&nbsp; Their faces, earnest, eager, loving, came
into the full light from the candle dips.&nbsp; And there, far
into the night, Azalea talked to them, secure in her sense of
love and peace.</p>
<p>Afterward, when they all had lighted her to her chamber, and
then had left her, she stood <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>for a while on her little gallery
listening to the whippoorwills and looking at the low
stars.&nbsp; It seemed as if messages of good will came from the
birds, from the near dark forest, from the loud-singing
stream.&nbsp; All was familiar and dear.&nbsp; And her fragrant
chamber welcomed her with the silent sweetness to be found only
in well-loved rooms.</p>

247</span>CHAPTER XIV<br />
THE SACRIFICE</h2>
<p>Among the wide acres of the Atherton place was a certain field
known since the memory of the grandfathers as &ldquo;The Field of
Arrows.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a level, sunny spot, surrounded by
low hills.&nbsp; It backed, indeed, against a hill, and a little
stream with mirror-like pools ran around it with scythe-like
grace.&nbsp; The Field of Arrows was almost a semicircle, and it
was as pleasant a spot as any around about Lee, beautiful though
that region was.</p>
<p>It had taken its name from the great number of flint
arrowheads, the handicraft of the Cherokees or of some earlier
race, who had camped or fought in that spot.&nbsp; Perhaps they
had raised their maize there too.&nbsp; At any rate, the good
Indian corn was growing there now, putting up its blade-like
leaves courageously to the young summer air.&nbsp; Midway of the
field, that is to say, reaching from the center of its base and
running to the highest point of its circle, a fine broad <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>pathway
stretched, and beside this path poppies and daisies, mint and
mountain pinks had leave to grow when their hour should
come.&nbsp; The path led from the stepping stones and the shady
cove where the kettles and tubs stood for washing, to a cabin
with two picturesque outside chimneys made of the field stone and
the reliable red clay, which held them together with brave
determination.&nbsp; A light gallery ran in front of the house,
with benches made of stout ash, pushed back against the wall, and
that best of drinking cups, a long-handled, polished gourd, hung
on the wall above an old Indian water jar, hollowed from
soapstone.</p>
<p>Within were four rooms of equal size, and back of the house
was a summer kitchen.&nbsp; And everything about the place, from
the latticed passageway that led to the kitchen, to the
serviceable crane that swung in the chief fireplace, spoke of
home and comfort.&nbsp; The little windows looked out on a
prosperous scene; the mulberry tree, with its golden bark, had
places of hiding and nestling for half a dozen children.&nbsp;
The bowlders in the stream sheltered ideal swimming holes.&nbsp;
The chestnut and butternut trees on the <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>hill behind
the house suggested happy autumn days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a perfect place for children,&rdquo; decided
Mrs. Carson.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s where Hi&rsquo;s
family shall live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had taken him to see it, and he had looked at it with eyes
which seemed to recognize it as a home returned to, rather than
as one just found.</p>
<p>So, while he and Mr. Carson took their three days&rsquo;
journey to Hi&rsquo;s home, Mrs. Carson busied herself with the
cabin.&nbsp; The lattice was freshly whitewashed; the fireplaces
within the house and the chimneys that ran up visibly to the
ceiling, were painted a dark red.&nbsp; The floors and walls were
purified, and the whole place furnished with new, strong mountain
furniture.&nbsp; Rag rugs were put on the floor, fresh curtains
at the windows, a good stove set up in the kitchen, the
comfortable beds were provided with new bedding, and a fine
little old clock, taken from the attic of The Shoals, and a
mirror from the same place, in its antique frame, were set in
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell your mother to come right along,&rdquo; Mrs.
Carson had warned Hi.&nbsp; &ldquo;If she has any particular
treasure she wishes to bring, well and <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>good.&nbsp;
But she&rsquo;s not to bother about anything else.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;ll be glad to have new things to look at.&nbsp; Women
get dreadfully tired looking at the same furniture day in and day
out.&nbsp; I believe a new outfit for the house at the right time
would have kept many a woman from going insane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessum,&rdquo; agreed Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;Going over and
over a thing is what wears you out, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carson had held some doubts as to the ability of her
husband and Hi to persuade a woman to &ldquo;pull up
stakes&rdquo; at an hour&rsquo;s notice and to go to a place she
perhaps had never heard of.&nbsp; But it appeared that Mrs.
Kitchell, like her son, was ready for adventure.&nbsp; Asking no
more time than it took to wash and iron the handful of clothes
possessed by the family, she packed all her worldly
goods&mdash;or at least, all she cared to retain&mdash;in an old
haircloth trunk, and smiling and expectant, turned her face
toward Lee.&nbsp; It was a little brown, nutlike face, much like
Hi&rsquo;s, and it was really carved in smiles in spite of all
her troubles.&nbsp; There were worried marks between her brows,
it is true, but the laughing marks about her eyes and the corners
of her mouth, discounted them.</p>
<p>The democrat wagon from The Shoals was <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>at the
station to meet the party, and Mrs. Carson, who had driven down
in her little pony cart, helped to get the family settled in
it.&nbsp; The little hair trunk was put in behind, and the tribe
of Kitchell, with a new light in their bright black eyes, turned
to the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dear little strong, staunch woman, isn&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo; said Lucy Carson to her husband as they drove toward
their home.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the two girls are as nice little
daughters as anyone would care to have&mdash;much better looking
than Hi.&nbsp; But the fourth child, the little boy, looks
sickly.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have to put him on special
diet&mdash;plenty of milk and eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Carson smiled happily to himself.&nbsp; The languor was
going out of his wife&rsquo;s voice; the pallor of her face was
flushed with a lovely rose pink.&nbsp; As she sat beside him, in
her soft cream-colored frock, with her lilac scarf drifting from
her shoulders, her pale amethysts in their setting of old yellow
gold clasping collar and belt, he thought her the sweetest woman
he ever had seen.&nbsp; She was sweeter even than before sorrow
had come to her.&nbsp; He had loved her then; but there was
something very like worship in the feeling he had toward her
now.</p>
<p><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drive on through the hills the short
way,&rdquo; she said, brimful and flowing over with the
home-romance of the Kitchells, &ldquo;and be at the door to
welcome them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they were.&nbsp; As the democrat wagon drew up, filled
with the wondering and somewhat awed Kitchells, their good
&ldquo;neighbors&rdquo;&mdash;they would not have tolerated the
word &ldquo;benefactors&rdquo;&mdash;stood at the door of the
cabin to meet them.&nbsp; And tired little Anne Kitchell, her
four children following her, stepped into the door of her new
home.&nbsp; The old life with the shame of a drunken husband,
killed in a shameful row, was left behind.&nbsp; She had the
chance to begin a new life, and to this feeling the new furniture
of the house contributed more than she could realize.</p>
<p>Hi ran from room to room, staring, his big mouth open, his
heart swelling.&nbsp; Once he waved his long arms over his head,
unable to contain himself, and not wanting to really whoop with
delight.&nbsp; He listened while Mrs. Carson talked to his mother
of this and that; showed her the kitchen and the store closets,
with their supplies of food and of house linen, and the plain,
good wardrobes she had prepared for the family.</p>
<p><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;ve made any mistakes, Mrs. Kitchell,
the things can be changed.&nbsp; I worked according to Hi&rsquo;s
direction.&nbsp; No, you&rsquo;re not to thank me.&nbsp; Not at
all.&nbsp; This is a sort of bonus offered you for your being so
obliging in coming to us in our need.&nbsp; We want to get our
factory started as soon as possible, and we couldn&rsquo;t spare
you the time to sew for your family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke in a brisk bright way new to her, and even Hi, boy
that he was, could see that a great change was coming over
her.&nbsp; She had reminded him of a tall white lily, drooping at
the close of a hot day; but now she was like that same lily in
the morning, and her petals were touched with pink.</p>
<p>So Anne Kitchell was not allowed to weep out her gratitude,
though a dozen times she thought she was going to; she was
filled, instead, with a new desire to work and to &ldquo;be
somebody.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was no one here to saddle the old
shameful stories on her&mdash;to refer to her as a
drunkard&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; She would be taken at her own
valuation, and in her keen, quick little brain she began to
understand that the valuation might be a high one if she chose to
make it so.</p>
<p>Mary McBirney gave her only a day or two <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>to settle
herself in her new home, and then, with a pail of mountain honey
and a crock of cottage cheese by way of gifts, she came to see
her.&nbsp; They liked each other at once, though the life of one
had enabled her to make the best of herself, and the life of the
other had kept her fighting like an angry rat.&nbsp; But the
honesty that underlay the character of each, and the interest
each had in Hi, and in Azalea&mdash;indeed, in children in
general&mdash;helped them over the little strangeness they might
have felt.</p>
<p>But Ma McBirney was restless.&nbsp; There was something on her
conscience&mdash;something that had been there ever since her
husband had told her that Azalea was the granddaughter of old
Colonel Atherton, and that, if fortune had treated her kindly,
The Shoals, and all the comforts and opportunities that went with
the possession of the estate, would have been hers.&nbsp; True,
the fine place had passed legitimately into the hands of the
Carsons; yet knowing the generous and abounding nature of the
Carsons as she did, she realized that were they to be told the
truth about Azalea, they would at once offer her a home, and
would give her an education such as their own daughter was
receiving.</p>
<p><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a wicked woman,&rdquo; said Mary
McBirney to herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m selfish and
sinful.&nbsp; Just to give myself happiness, I&rsquo;m keeping
that dear child away from what belongs to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought had goaded her for days.&nbsp; More, it had crept
into the wakeful hours of the night.&nbsp; It had tortured her as
she watched Azalea busy about the house, singing, or thinking in
her intense, curious way.&nbsp; When the girl flung her arms
about Ma McBirney&rsquo;s neck, calling her the sweetest thing in
the world, and saying how happy she was to be back with her
again, it seemed as if Ma McBirney&rsquo;s heart actually turned
over in her side, with dread of losing her, and with shame at her
own cowardice.</p>
<p>So, on the day she called on Mrs. Kitchell, she summoned her
better angel&mdash;though it was difficult to imagine that Mary
McBirney could be surrounded with anything but good
angels&mdash;and made her way to The Shoals.</p>
<p>From every window of the great white house fluttered orange
and white awnings.&nbsp; The lawn was trim and green; the flower
beds aglow with lovely fresh blooms.&nbsp; Hammocks and couches
swung on the wide gallery, and linen-covered chairs and great
East Indian jugs filled with <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>growing plants, stood about.&nbsp;
Ma McBirney paused before the wide door with its fan-shaped
transom and looked about her wistfully.&nbsp; By saying a word,
Azalea could leave the humble little home which was now hers, and
come down to enjoy the bright hospitality of this beautiful
place.&nbsp; Music, books, travel&mdash;all of these things would
come to her.&nbsp; Mary McBirney remembered how she herself had
longed for opportunity in those early days when she first became
aware of her ignorance, and how she had &ldquo;given up&rdquo;
and gone her quiet way&mdash;the way to which she was born.&nbsp;
But Azalea was not like that.&nbsp; She could not be happy in
giving up an education and all that would go to make her capable
and able to measure herself with the best.&nbsp; What had meant
contentment for her, Mary McBirney, would mean failure for
Azalea.</p>
<p>She turned these matters over in her large, kind mind,
and&mdash;rang Mrs. Carson&rsquo;s doorbell.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carson&rsquo;s parlor maid, black, smiling, and chubby,
answered the summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tulula Darthula,&rdquo; said Mrs. McBirney in her soft
voice, &ldquo;might I see your mistress?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll inquiah, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied
Tulula in even softer tones.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be pleased to
enteh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McBirney would have been quite content to sit on the
porch, but the thoughts surging in her brain impelled her to
accept Tulula&rsquo;s invitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be seated in the mornin&rsquo; room,
ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McBirney hesitated a moment.&nbsp; Then she said
shyly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t think Mrs. Carson would mind,
Tulula, I&rsquo;d like to sit in the drawing room this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why ce&rsquo;t&rsquo;ney, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Suit
yo&rsquo;sef.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tulula rustled away with her message, and Mary McBirney, who
all her life had seen only the mountain or the village homes,
entered the long shadowy drawing room, with its paintings, its
occasional white statue, its shining floor and carved furniture,
and sitting there, measuring all this meant of knowledge and
delight, steeled her heart for the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Then Mr. and Mrs. Carson entered together, and upborn by love,
Mrs. McBirney went to meet them, saying:</p>
<p><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>&ldquo;I asked to come in here for&mdash;for a
reason.&nbsp; I hope you don&rsquo;t mind,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our home is for our friends,&rdquo; answered Mrs.
Carson gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would like to see you here often,
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew, somehow, that Mary McBirney had a great thing to
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the reason:&rdquo; said Mrs. McBirney.&nbsp;
And then she told them the whole story.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>It had been rainy Sunday.&nbsp; The rain began before
daylight; it wiped out the sunrise, and it turned what should
have been a golden midsummer day into mere blankness and
desolation.&nbsp; At least, a person could look at it that way if
he wanted to.</p>
<p>Up at the McBirney house no one had thought of dressing for
church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one but a fish could get anywhere to-day,&rdquo;
said Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel just as if we were living under a
waterfall,&rdquo; declared Azalea.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we
do to-day, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rsquo;less you tell me
stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piggy, I don&rsquo;t want to do all the thinking.&nbsp;
If I tell stories you&rsquo;ve got to tell them too.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>nice we&rsquo;re going to have chicken for dinner,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;&nbsp; She sniffed the air contentedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet it is.&nbsp; And strawberries and &rsquo;lasses
cake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Carin&rsquo;s doing, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fooling &rsquo;round in that there studio of
hern.&nbsp; My, but she can paint, can&rsquo;t she?&nbsp; Did you
see that picture she done of me sitting up in the
willer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim McBirney, what makes you talk like that?&nbsp; You
know better than to say &lsquo;done&rsquo; for &lsquo;did&rsquo;
and you know willow isn&rsquo;t pronounced
&lsquo;willer.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Zalie, you leave me alone and let me
talk like I want to.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t got on my Sunday
clothes, have I?&nbsp; Well then, I don&rsquo;t have to put on
Sunday talk.&nbsp; Just let me feel comfortable, can&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Carin were up here to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Hi.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather have Hi.&nbsp; Carin
makes me kind o&rsquo; squirm.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a mighty nice
girl, but she don&rsquo;t make me feel to home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim, she&rsquo;s lovely.&nbsp; And such fun
too!&nbsp; She can get up the best plays you ever heard
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>&ldquo;Girl plays, I reckon.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t
think of anything that would interest boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe boys wouldn&rsquo;t have the sense to be
interested, smarty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children,&rdquo; broke in the soft voice of Ma
McBirney, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the dinner in the oven and there
ain&rsquo;t nothing occupying me just at present.&nbsp;
Wouldn&rsquo;t one of you read me a story from them
<i>Youth&rsquo;s Companions</i> Carin sent home by pa last
night?&nbsp; Seems as if it would pass the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children flushed a little.&nbsp; They knew when ma
disliked their way of talking.&nbsp; She had her own particular
fashion of correcting them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You read, Azalea,&rdquo; said Jim, sinking into a chair
and staring out of the rain-beaten window.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
you&rsquo;ll have to read good and loud to get ahead of this
bellering and roaring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, indeed, the wind shook the cabin, and the rain fluttered
down the chimney; the stream that tumbled down the mountain side
was fairly shouting and the trees were beating their drenched
branches together with a sound like the rushing of great
birds.&nbsp; But high above the elemental din, Azalea&rsquo;s
clear voice arose.&nbsp; And peace dwelt within the cabin.&nbsp;
It dwelt there <a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>while the children set the table for the good dinner
that Mrs. McBirney had cooked, and while they devoured that
dinner with perfect concentration of purpose.&nbsp; And
afterward, when ma had read a psalm to them, and pa had told a
story about something that happened to him when he was a boy and
the fires were raging over the mountains, they settled down to a
quiet game of jack straws on the deal table.</p>
<p>And then, just as they were on the point of being bored again,
the storm cleared.&nbsp; Above them the deep blue sky shone
through the fleecy whiteness of the clouds, and beneath them torn
fragments of cloud swam along like floating islands over the
purple valley.&nbsp; The sunset came in rose and gold, and in the
east a proud young moon, bright as a happy bride, swam up into
the heavens.</p>
<p>The McBirneys, silent and happy, cloaked against the dampness,
sat at &ldquo;Outlook Point&rdquo; and looked about them at the
beautiful world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is as good as church, to my way of
thinking,&rdquo; remarked Thomas McBirney.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you
can&rsquo;t worship the Almighty when you see a thing like this,
then there ain&rsquo;t no manner of worship in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Thomas?&nbsp; Singing?&rdquo;
asked his wife.</p>
<p>Something sweet and clear troubled the silence, and as the
four harkened it swelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Singing!&rdquo; decided Thomas.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who can it
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; cried Azalea gayly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Carsons!&nbsp; Oh, ma, it&rsquo;s Carin and
her father and mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something gripped Mary McBirney&rsquo;s loving, jealous
heart.&nbsp; She knew why they were coming.&nbsp; She had asked
them to come for this very thing, but when the rain had set in,
it had seemed like an answer to her secret prayers&mdash;those
prayers which she would not admit to herself that she prayed, and
which were no more than her &ldquo;heart&rsquo;s sincere
desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horses drew nearer; the words of the song could be
heard.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now the day is over,<br />
Night is drawing nigh&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three voices, softly blended, sang the familiar lines to
the slow motion of their horses.</p>
<p><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>Azalea ran to the edge of the &ldquo;Outlook&rdquo; and
sent her clear voice, rested and refreshed from the strain it had
undergone in the days of her enforced singing of noisy songs,
ringing down the mountain side.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Shadows of the evening,<br />
Steal across the sky.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tightness at Ma McBirney&rsquo;s heart increased.&nbsp;
How like her Azalea was to these others&mdash;like them in voice
and manner, and unafraid of them!&nbsp; They had heard her, for
Mr. Carson interrupted himself to call out to her.&nbsp; Then the
song went on, and there were four singing it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jesus give the weary<br />
Calm and sweet repose;<br />
With Thy tenderest blessing,<br />
May our eyelids close.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the sounds grew fainter as the windings of the road took
them away; then they swelled again, as the horses returned on the
winding road.&nbsp; But Azalea sang on, delighting in the <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>song her
mother had taught her&mdash;the song that had comforted her when
she had grown sick at heart at all the silly things she had been
obliged to sing when she was &ldquo;the show girl.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Grant to little children,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Visions bright of Thee;<br />
Guard the sailors tossing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the deep, blue sea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They are here,&rdquo; said Ma McBirney in so solemn a
voice that Jim and Azalea stared at her, wondering.</p>
<p>And so they were.&nbsp; They dismounted easily, threw their
bridles, Western fashion, over the heads of their horses, and
walked forward with pleasant greetings.&nbsp; But even their
voices were different.&nbsp; They too seemed solemn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be the night,&rdquo; thought Azalea.&nbsp; She
took Carin&rsquo;s hand, and they all walked back to the Point,
and sat there watching the little islands of cloud as they
floated across the path of the moon and turned from cloud into
something precious and radiant, not quite so pale as silver nor
as bright as gold.</p>
<h2><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>CHAPTER XV<br />
AZALEA CHOOSES</h2>
<p>&ldquo;We might be eagles&mdash;or angels,&rdquo; murmured
Mrs. Carson, sinking into her seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t stand it in the house any
longer,&rdquo; Carin explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;We made up our minds
we&rsquo;d have a ride even if the roads were bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ford must have been pretty deep,&rdquo; remarked Pa
McBirney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took the leading straps of the horses the ladies were
riding, and we made a rush for it together,&rdquo; Mr. Carson
explained.</p>
<p>Then silence fell.&nbsp; There certainly was something strange
about the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had other reasons for coming up here
to-night,&rdquo; Mr. Carson said at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;We came
because we knew that we could sit out here with you all, and that
we could all look at this wonderful scene, and forget all about
our bodies, and our troubles, and our little human way of looking
at things.&nbsp; We could be, as my wife <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>said, like
eagles, or like angels.&nbsp; We could realize that we really
were spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Ma McBirney who murmured: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came,&rdquo; went on Mr. Carson gently, &ldquo;to
ask Azalea to make a choice.&nbsp; We are going to invite her to
live with us and to be as our own daughter.&nbsp; She will share
equally with Carin in everything; at least as far as it is
possible for us to make an equal division.&nbsp; We know the
story of her life and that under more fortunate circumstances the
home we live in would have been hers.&nbsp; She would have been
educated in the best manner and fitted for the life of a lady of
position.&nbsp; Now, of our four children only one is left.&nbsp;
So we offer her a share of our hearts and our substance.&nbsp; Do
you understand, Azalea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin threw an arm about Azalea&rsquo;s waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, say yes, dear.&nbsp; We will be so
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will make you welcome from our heart of
hearts,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carson.&nbsp; But it seemed as if she
were holding something back; and Azalea saw her white hand laid
upon Ma McBirney&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>The moon had gone under a dense cloud, and they were left in
the bland, moist darkness.&nbsp; And <a name="page267"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>in that darkness there gleamed
before Azalea&rsquo;s mental gaze, the two homes&mdash;the great,
beautiful manor, and the mountain cabin.&nbsp; She knew little of
the life in the former, but what she did know of it came to her
now with all its ease, its pleasure, and its promise.&nbsp; She
thought of the struggle there in the mountain home; of the
sacrifice, the hard work, the eternal &ldquo;doing
without.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, as if something above and beyond her
came to her to lift her out of herself, she glimpsed the kind
wishes and helpful affection of those in the manor; and over
against them she placed the tense and tender love of Mary
McBirney who had clasped her to her heart when she was
motherless.</p>
<p>They did not need her at the manor; but she was greatly needed
in the cabin.&nbsp; Love demanded tribute of her.&nbsp; And
suddenly, Azalea knew what she must do.&nbsp; If Ma McBirney
loved her like a mother, she, Azalea, gave back a
daughter&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; There was, after all, nothing worth
thinking of save that&mdash;save love.&nbsp; A warm glow swept
over her, and the deepest sense of contentment she ever had known
in all her restless, curious life of change filled her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of everything,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; <a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>&ldquo;And I thank you, thank you, thank you&mdash;you
dears!&rdquo;&nbsp; She turned toward the Carsons, and they could
see that she was holding out her hands in the gloom.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But this is my home.&nbsp; Ma McBirney is dearer to me
than any one now on the earth.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stay with
her&mdash;if she wants me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she suddenly remembered that Mrs. McBirney had not
said a word to oppose Mr. Carson&rsquo;s arguments.&nbsp; Could
it be, that because of their poverty, they <i>wished</i> her to
go to The Shoals?&nbsp; Little cold tremors ran over her, and her
heart turned sick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, ma, do you want me?&rdquo; she cried with sharp
agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want you!&rdquo; sobbed ma, holding out her arms.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Want you, honey bird?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moon swam out again into the clear sky, transfiguring
their world.&nbsp; A mocking bird began to sing, whistling low,
muffled notes of sad sweetness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the word of truth you have spoken, Azalea,&rdquo;
said Mr. Carson slowly, &ldquo;and I thank you for your honesty,
and for your nobility too, my dear.&nbsp; We understand
everything; don&rsquo;t we Lucy, my love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Carson.</p>
<p><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>&ldquo;But now we have something to say which is not a
request, but practically a command.&nbsp; Next week Miss
Parkhurst, a friend of mine and a teacher of unusual ability, is
coming to instruct Carin.&nbsp; You are to come daily, Azalea, to
share her lessons with her.&nbsp; And that the going and coming
may not be too much for you, we are sending a well-trained little
horse to you.&nbsp; Its feed and keep shall be, so far as
possible, the care of my stable boys, so that my good friend
McBirney, who is so willing to take other people&rsquo;s burdens
on him, may not have another one added.&nbsp; But I promise you
all, for myself and for Mrs. Carson and Carin, that you shall be
thought of, Azalea, as the daughter of this home here on the
mountains.&nbsp; And while we shall give you all you will take in
the way of schooling and development, we will not do one thing to
win you away from the life you have chosen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; murmured Azalea.&nbsp; She could
say no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; added Ma McBirney, crushing down
the tormenting little doubts that would arise in her heart.&nbsp;
Could she really keep this scarlet tanager in her wren&rsquo;s
nest?</p>
<p><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>But
no doubts troubled the others.&nbsp; Jim sat thinking and
thinking.&nbsp; What wonderful things came to Zalie!&nbsp; And
he&mdash;he was a gawk&mdash;a dunce&mdash;a silly hill
billy!&nbsp; He wondered Azalea paid any attention to him!&nbsp;
And yet, somehow, she seemed to think of herself as his
sister.&nbsp; Well, then, he&rsquo;d stick by her, sir, no matter
what happened.&nbsp; Till he was an old man with long white
whiskers he&rsquo;d stick by her, and if anyone did her any sort
of harm, he&rsquo;d fix him.&nbsp; He almost leaped to his feet
and stood there straight and fierce with his own combat, beside
the girl.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p270.jpg">
<img alt=
"He stood there, straight and fierce"
title=
"He stood there, straight and fierce"
 src="images/p270.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot to say,&rdquo; observed Mr. Carson in his slow
way, &ldquo;that there will be two little horses.&nbsp; They were
a pair and the man didn&rsquo;t want to sell them singly.&nbsp;
So the second one is for Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Jim, and his voice sounded almost
defiant in his excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; cried Mr. Carson, mocking him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shake hands on it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he wrung Jim&rsquo;s
hand in his own.&nbsp; Then the boy&rsquo;s shyness came on him
and made him slip away in the darkness.&nbsp; Yet he was on hand
to hold the horses when the Carsons were ready to mount.</p>
<p>They rode away in the moonlight, with the bewitching world of
cloud and shine about them.&nbsp; <a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>The trees were transformed into
enchanted silver things amid which elves and dryads seemed to
hide; the rushing water was a torrent of dancing crystal where
the water maidens played.&nbsp; The three who rode away, went
singing.&nbsp; But this time it was a song that Azalea did not
know.&nbsp; She said so to Ma McBirney with a troubled smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lovely, lovely song!&nbsp; And I never so much
as heard it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ma McBirney kissed her slowly, and said with meaning:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you see, Zalie, they are going to teach it to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea did not answer.&nbsp; She lighted her candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Night, Jim,&rdquo; she called.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
couldn&rsquo;t get rid of me, could you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could if I tried.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Pa McBirney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, daughter.&rdquo; It was the first time he
ever had called her that.&nbsp; She slipped over and bending
above him, dropped a kiss on his brow as he sat there in the open
room&mdash;the queer two-sided chamber that divided the closed
rooms of the house.</p>
<p><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;d better go to your room with
you,&rdquo; said Ma McBirney, &ldquo;and see you safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So together they climbed the rude stairs to that cotelike
chamber that looked out on the transfigured mountain.&nbsp; All
about them, save for the throating of the mocking bird, was
silence.&nbsp; And in silence the two parted for the night.&nbsp;
They had no need of words.&nbsp; Stronger than any mere accident
of relationship was the love and trust in their hearts.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
